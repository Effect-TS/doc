## Some bundle costs

- Effect's core fiber runtime comes in at about 30kb minified
- Effect schema comes in at about another 40kb
- anything else scales fairly linearly and treeshakes well


### What do these costs mean

While these numbers mean nothing on the backend, and very little for effect powered frontend applications,
using Effect schema may not be a great choice for a general frontend library.


### How to deal with it?

- For basic parsing inside clients we recommend to build json-schema from Schemas, and e.g use the [jsonschema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonschema) (4kb gz) library instead.
- It might be enough to include the hash of the schema in the response, and accept the response in your client if this hash matches

in both cases you will loose the rich decoding features from Schema, but you might not need them as much in your library.
everyone can convert ISO string to Dates, right?

## Some processing costs

- Effect is not built to replace well optimised and purely algorithmic code. This will always be slower than native. But the good news is that Effect code happily embeds/calls such code.

<Warning>
  Micro is still experimental, and we're looking for feedback on how it can be
  improved.

The **Micro** module in Effect is designed as a lightweight alternative to the standard `Effect` module, specifically for scenarios where reducing bundle size is crucial.

This module is self-contained and does not include more complex features like `Layer`, `Ref`, `Queue`, and `Deferred`.

If any major Effect modules (beyond basic data modules like `Option`, `Either`, `Array`, etc.) are used, the effect runtime will be added to your bundle, negating the benefits of Micro.

This makes Micro ideal for libraries that aim to implement Effect functionality with minimal impact on bundle size, especially for libraries that plan to expose `Promise`-based APIs.

It also supports scenarios where a client might use Micro while a server uses the full suite of Effect features, maintaining compatibility and shared logic between different parts of an application.

At a minimum, Micro adds **5kb gzipped** to your bundle, and scales with the amount of features you use.

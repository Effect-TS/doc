Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers easily create complex, synchronous and asynchronous programs. With a focus on fibers and functional effects, Effect makes it easy to implement features like async cancellation and safe resource management.

At the heart of Effect is the `Effect<Context, Error, Success>` type, which represents a program that requires a specific `Context`, may fail for a typed `Error` or, in the case of success, returns a `Success` value. This powerful type forms the foundation for a vast set of modules that can be used to model the needs of any type of application.

One of the key benefits of Effect is its rich ecosystem, which includes a wide range of modules that make it easy to implement common functionality. Whether you're building a web application, a mobile app, or a backend system, Effect has the tools you need to get the job done.

Despite its comprehensive nature, Effect is fully tree-shakeable and ESM compliant, meaning that only the modules and functions you actually use will be included in your bundled code. This ensures that you can use Effect without worrying about bloating your application with unnecessary code.

Overall, Effect is a versatile and powerful tool that makes it easy to build complex, asynchronous programs in TypeScript. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Effect has something to offer you.

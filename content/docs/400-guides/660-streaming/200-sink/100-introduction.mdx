In the world of streams, a `Sink<R, E, In, L, Z>` plays a crucial role. It's like a specialized function designed to consume elements generated by a `Stream`. Here's a breakdown of what a `Sink` does:

- It can consume a varying number of `In` elements, which might be zero, one, or more.
- It has the potential to encounter errors of type `E`.
- Ultimately, it produces a value of type `Z`.
- Additionally, it can return a remainder of type `L`, which represents any leftover elements.

To use a `Sink` for processing a stream, you simply pass it to the `Stream.run` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/introduction/run.ts

```

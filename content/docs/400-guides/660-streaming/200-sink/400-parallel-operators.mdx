In this section, we'll explore parallel operations that allow you to run multiple sinks concurrently. These operations can be quite useful when you need to perform tasks simultaneously.

## Parallel Zipping: Combining Results

When you want to run two sinks concurrently and combine their results, you can use `Sink.zip`. This operation runs both sinks concurrently and combines their outcomes into a tuple:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/parallel-operators/zip.ts

```

## Racing: First One Wins

Another useful operation is `Sink.race`, which lets you race multiple sinks concurrently. The sink that completes first will provide the result for your program:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/parallel-operators/race.ts

```

## schedule

When working with streams, you might need to introduce specific time intervals between each emission of stream elements. This can be achieved using the `Stream.schedule` combinator.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/scheduling/schedule.ts

```

In this example, we've used the `Schedule.spaced("1 seconds")` schedule to introduce a one-second gap between each emission in the stream.

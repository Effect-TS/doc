## Should we do `runMain(program)`

## Should we use `_` or `$` for generators

## Avoid Tacit Function Calls like `map(f)` and Using `flow`

In Effect, it's recommended not to use functions point-free, meaning avoiding tacit usage.

While you're free to use tacit functions if you prefer, it's important to know that it can cause issues. It's safer to use `(x) => fn(x)` instead.

Using functions tacitly, especially with optional parameters, can be unsafe. If a function has overloads, using it tacitly might erase all generics, leading to bugs. For example, check out this X thread: [link to thread](https://twitter.com/MichaelArnaldi/status/1670715270845935616).

TypeScript inference can also be compromised when using tacit functions, which can lead to unexpected errors. So, it's not just a matter of style; it's a protective measure to avoid mistakes.

Additionally, stack traces may not be as clear when tacit usage is involved. It's risky without much benefit, as TypeScript may not properly check arguments, especially with optional ones, leading to potential issues.

It's worth trying without tacit usage, especially when dealing with generic functions with overloads, as using them tacitly can result in losing the generics.

## Avoid `instanceof`

A `Supervisor<A>` is a tool that manages the creation and termination of fibers, producing some visible value of type `A` based on its supervision.

## Creating

### track

To create a supervisor, you can use the `Supervisor.track` function. It generates a new supervisor that keeps track of its child fibers in a set.

## Supervising

### supervised

Whenever you need to supervise an effect, you can employ the `Effect.supervised` function. This function takes a supervisor and returns an effect that behaves the same as the original effect. However, all child fibers forked within this effect are reported to the specified supervisor.

By doing this, you associate the behavior of child fibers with the provided supervisor, giving you access to all the information about these child fibers through the supervisor.

## Example

In the following example, we will periodically monitor the number of fibers throughout our application's lifecycle:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/supervisor/example.ts

```

Welcome to the documentation for `@effect/platform`, a library designed for creating platform-independent abstractions (Node.js, Bun, browsers).

With `@effect/platform`, you can incorporate abstract services like `Terminal` or `FileSystem` into your program. Later, during the assembly of the final application, you can provide specific layers for the target platform using the corresponding packages: `platform-node`, `platform-bun`, and `platform-browser`.

This package empowers you to perform various operations, such as:

| **Module**    | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Command       | Creating and running a command with the specified process name and an optional list of arguments |
| FileSystem    | Reading and writing from/to the file system                                                      |
| KeyValueStore | Storing and retrieving key-value pairs                                                           |
| Terminal      | Reading and writing from/to standard input/output                                                |

By utilizing `@effect/platform`, you can write code that remains platform-agnostic, ensuring compatibility across different environments.

## Requirements

- TypeScript **5.0** or newer
- The `strict` flag enabled in your `tsconfig.json` file

Additionally, make sure to install the `effect` package, as it's peer dependencies. Note that some package managers might not install peer dependencies by default, so you need to install them manually.

## Installation

To install the **beta** version:

```bash
npm install @effect/platform
```

Additionally, make sure to install the `effect` package, as it's peer dependencies. Note that some package managers might not install peer dependencies by default, so you need to install them manually.

Once you have installed the library, you can import the necessary types and functions from the `@effect/platform/*` modules.

**Example** (Namespace Import)

```ts twoslash
import * as Command from "@effect/platform/Command"
```

**Example** (Named Import)

```ts twoslash
import { Command } from "@effect/platform"
```

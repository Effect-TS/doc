In the context of programming, a **service** refers to a reusable component or functionality that can be used by different parts of an application.
Services are designed to provide specific capabilities and can be shared across multiple modules or components.

Services often encapsulate common tasks or operations that are needed by different parts of an application.
They can handle complex operations, interact with external systems or APIs, manage data, or perform other specialized tasks.

Services are typically designed to be modular and decoupled from the rest of the application.
This allows them to be easily maintained, tested, and replaced without affecting the overall functionality of the application.

When working with services in Effect, it is important to understand the concept of **context**: in the type `Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>`, the parameter `Requirements` represents the services required by the effect to be executed.
These services are stored in a collection called `Context`.

## Managing Services with Effects

So far, we have been working with effects that don't require any specific service. In those cases, the `Requirements` parameter in the `Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>` type has always been of type `never`.

However, there are situations where we need to work with effects that depend on specific services.

These services are stored in a collection called `Context`.

The `Context` acts as a container for all the services an effect might need. By leveraging this context, you can manage requirements effectively, ensuring that each part of your application has access to the necessary services without tight coupling.

In this guide, we will learn how to:

- Create Effects that depend on a specific context.
- Work with Effects that require a context.
- Provide the required context to the Effect.

## Creating a Simple Service

Let's start by creating a service for generating random numbers.

To create a new service, you need two things:

- A unique identifier.
- A type describing the possible operations of the service.

Let's define our first service:

- We'll use the string `"MyRandomService"` as the unique identifier.
- The service type will have a single operation called `next` that returns a random number.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}
```

The exported `Random` value is known as a **tag** in Effect. It acts as a representation of the service and allows Effect to locate and use this service at runtime.

The service will be stored in a collection called `Context`, which can be thought of as a `Map` where the keys are tags and the values are services: `Context = Map<Tag, Service>`.

<Info>
You need to specify an identifier (in this case, the string `"MyRandomService"`) to make the tag global. This ensures that two tags with the same identifier refer to the same instance.

Using a unique identifier is particularly useful in scenarios where live reloads can occur, as it helps preserve the instance across reloads. It ensures there is no duplication of instances (although it shouldn't happen, some bundlers and frameworks can behave unpredictably)

</Info>

**Summary**

In the Effect, understanding services, tags, and context is essential for managing requirements and building modular applications.

| **Concept** | **Description**                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service** | A reusable component providing specific functionality, used across different parts of an application.   |
| **Tag**     | A unique identifier representing a **service**, allowing Effect to locate and use it.                   |
| **Context** | A collection storing services, functioning like a map with **tags** as keys and **services** as values. |

## Using the Service

Now that we have our service tag defined, let's see how we can use it by building a simple program.

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next
  console.log(`random number: ${randomNumber}`)
})
```

In the code above, we can observe that we are able to yield the `Random` tag as if it were an `Effect` itself.
This allows us to access the `next` operation of the service.

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context, Console } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Random.pipe(
  Effect.andThen((random) => random.next),
  Effect.andThen((randomNumber) =>
    Console.log(`random number: ${randomNumber}`)
  )
)
```

In the code above, we can observe that we are able to flat-map over the `Random` Tag as if it were an Effect itself.
This allows us to access the `next` operation of the service within the `Effect.andThen` callback.
We then use the `Console.log` utility to log the generated random number.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

It's worth noting that the type of the `program` variable includes `Random` in the `Requirements` type parameter: `Effect<void, never, Random>`.

This indicates that our program requires the `Random` service to be provided in order to execute successfully.

If we attempt to execute the effect without providing the necessary service we will encounter a type-checking error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next
  console.log(`random number: ${randomNumber}`)
})

// ---cut---
Effect.runSync(program)
```

To resolve this error and successfully execute the program, we need to provide an actual implementation of the `Random` service.

In the next section, we will explore how to implement and provide the `Random` service to our program, enabling us to run it successfully.

## Providing a Service implementation

In order to provide an actual implementation of the `Random` service, we can utilize the `Effect.provideService` function.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next
  console.log(`random number: ${randomNumber}`)
})

// ---cut---
const runnable = Effect.provideService(program, Random, {
  next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random())
})

Effect.runPromise(runnable)
/*
Output:
random number: 0.8241872233134417
*/
```

In the code snippet above, we call the `program` that we defined earlier and provide it with an implementation of the `Random` service.
We use the `Effect.provideService` function to associate the `Random` tag with its implementation, an object with a `next` operation that generates a random number.

Notice that the `Requirements` type parameter of the `runnable` effect is now `never`. This indicates that the effect no longer requires any service to be provided. With the implementation of the `Random` service in place, we are able to run the program without any further requirements.

## Using Multiple Services

When we require the usage of more than one service, the process remains similar to what we've learned in defining a service, repeated for each service needed. Let's examine an example where we need two services, namely `Random` and `Logger`:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

// Create a tag for the 'Random' service
class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  {
    readonly next: Effect.Effect<number>
  }
>() {}

// Create a tag for the 'Logger' service
class Logger extends Context.Tag("MyLoggerService")<
  Logger,
  {
    readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Acquire instances of the 'Random' and 'Logger' services
  const random = yield* Random
  const logger = yield* Logger

  // Generate a random number using the 'Random' service
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next

  // Log the random number using the 'Logger' service
  return yield* logger.log(String(randomNumber))
})
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

// Create a tag for the 'Random' service
class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  {
    readonly next: Effect.Effect<number>
  }
>() {}

// Create a tag for the 'Logger' service
class Logger extends Context.Tag("MyLoggerService")<
  Logger,
  {
    readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

const program =
  // Acquire instances of the 'Random' and 'Logger' services
  Effect.all([Random, Logger]).pipe(
    Effect.andThen(([random, logger]) =>
      // Generate a random number using the 'Random' service
      random.next.pipe(
        Effect.andThen((randomNumber) =>
          // Log the random number using the 'Logger' service
          logger.log(String(randomNumber))
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `program` effect now has a `Requirements` type parameter of `Random | Logger`, indicating that it requires both the `Random` and `Logger` services to be provided.

To execute the `program`, we need to provide implementations for both services:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  {
    readonly next: Effect.Effect<number>
  }
>() {}

class Logger extends Context.Tag("MyLoggerService")<
  Logger,
  {
    readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random
  const logger = yield* Logger
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next
  return yield* logger.log(String(randomNumber))
})

// ---cut---
// Provide service implementations for 'Random' and 'Logger'
const runnable1 = program.pipe(
  Effect.provideService(Random, {
    next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random())
  }),
  Effect.provideService(Logger, {
    log: (message) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(message))
  })
)
```

Alternatively, instead of calling `provideService` multiple times, we can combine the service implementations into a single `Context` and then provide the entire context using the `Effect.provide` function:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  {
    readonly next: Effect.Effect<number>
  }
>() {}

class Logger extends Context.Tag("MyLoggerService")<
  Logger,
  {
    readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const random = yield* Random
  const logger = yield* Logger
  const randomNumber = yield* random.next
  return yield* logger.log(String(randomNumber))
})

// ---cut---
// Combine service implementations into a single 'Context'
const context = Context.empty().pipe(
  Context.add(Random, { next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random()) }),
  Context.add(Logger, {
    log: (message) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(message))
  })
)

// Provide the entire context to the 'program'
const runnable2 = Effect.provide(program, context)
```

By providing the necessary implementations for each service, we ensure that the runnable effect can access and utilize both services when it is executed.

## Optional Services

There are situations where we may want to access a service implementation only if it is available.
In such cases, we can use the `Effect.serviceOption` function to handle this scenario.

The `Effect.serviceOption` function returns an implementation that is available only if it is actually provided before executing this effect.
To represent this optionality it returns an [Option](../../other/data-types/option) of the implementation.

Let's take a look at an example that demonstrates the usage of optional services:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

To determine what action to take, we can use the `Option.isNone` function provided by the Option module. This function allows us to check if the service is available or not by returning `true` when the service is not available.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context, Option } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const maybeRandom = yield* Effect.serviceOption(Random)
  const randomNumber = Option.isNone(maybeRandom)
    ? // the service is not available, return a default value
      -1
    : // the service is available
      yield* maybeRandom.value.next
  console.log(randomNumber)
})
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

To determine if we can use the service, we can use the `Option.match` function provided by the `Option` module. This function allows us to perform different actions based on whether the service is available or not. It takes two callbacks as arguments: one for the case when the service is not available, and another for the case when it is available.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context, Option, Console } from "effect"

class Random extends Context.Tag("MyRandomService")<
  Random,
  { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }
>() {}

const program = Effect.serviceOption(Random).pipe(
  Effect.andThen((maybeRandom) =>
    Option.match(maybeRandom, {
      // the service is not available, return a default value
      onNone: () => Effect.succeed(-1),
      // the service is available
      onSome: (random) => random.next
    })
  ),
  Effect.andThen((randomNumber) => Console.log(`${randomNumber}`))
)
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

In the code above, we can observe that the `Requirements` type parameter of the `program` effect is `never`, even though we are working with a service. This allows us to access something from the context only if it is actually provided before executing this effect.

When we run the `program` effect without providing the `Random` service:

```ts
Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
// Output: -1
```

We see that the log message contains `-1`, which is the default value we provided when the service was not available.

However, if we provide the `Random` service implementation:

```ts
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provideService(program, Random, {
    next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random())
  })
).then(console.log)
// Output: 0.9957979486841035
```

We can observe that the log message now contains a random number generated by the `next` operation of the `Random` service.

By using the `Effect.serviceOption` function, we can gracefully handle scenarios where a service may or may not be available, providing flexibility in our programs.

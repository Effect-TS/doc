"Yieldable Errors" are special types of errors that can be yielded within a [generator function](../essentials/using-generators) used by `Effect.gen`. The unique feature of these errors is that you don't need to use the `Effect.fail` API explicitly to handle them. They offer a more intuitive and convenient way to work with custom errors in your code.

## Data.Error

The `Data.Error` constructor enables you to create a base yieldable error class. This class can be used to represent different types of errors in your code. Here's how you can use it:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/yieldable-errors/Error.ts

```

## Data.TaggedError

The `Data.TaggedError` constructor is useful for creating tagged yieldable errors. These errors bear a distinct property named `_tag`, which acts as their unique identifier, allowing you to differentiate them from one another. Here's how you can use it:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/yieldable-errors/TaggedError.ts

```

In this example, we create `FooError` and `BarError` classes with distinct tags ("Foo" and "Bar"). These tags help identify the type of error when handling errors in your code.

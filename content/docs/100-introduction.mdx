## What is Effect?

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers
easily create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs.

One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages
[structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency)
to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

## How to use these Docs

The documentation is structured in a sequential manner, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. This allows you to follow along step-by-step as you build your Effect application. However, you have the flexibility to read the documentation in any order or jump directly to the pages that are relevant to your specific use case.

To facilitate navigation within a page, you will find a table of contents on the right side of the screen. This allows you to easily jump between different sections of the page. Additionally, the breadcrumbs at the top of the page indicate the current location within the documentation, helping you keep track of where you are.

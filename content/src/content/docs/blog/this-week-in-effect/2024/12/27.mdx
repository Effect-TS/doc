Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

## Happy Holidays from the Effect Team

Dear Effecters,

As we roll out the final weekly update of the year, we want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your ongoing support and active engagement within the Effect community.

2024 has been a year of significant milestones, including the release of Effect 3.0, the first stable version of our ecosystem, a result of over five years of development.

We also launched the new Effect Website 2.0, rebuilt from the ground up to provide enhanced functionality and a better user experience.

These achievements were made possible thanks to your enthusiasm and contributions.

As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to continue this journey with you, with new developments and opportunities on the horizon.

Wishing you happy holidays and a wonderful New Year!

The Effect Team

Effect 3.11 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## Effect.fn

The `Effect.fn` api allows you to create a function that is automatically traced, and also
attaches the location where the function was called to any error traces.

It also doubles as a `pipe` function, allowing you to create a pipeline after the function
definition.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const logExample = Effect.fn("example")(function* <N extends number>(n: N) {
  yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n)
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`got: ${n}`)
  yield* Effect.fail(new Error())
}, Effect.delay("1 second"))

Effect.runFork(logExample(100).pipe(Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError)))
```

## Time zone support in Cron

Cron expressions using the `Cron` module now support time zones. You can specify a time zone
when creating a cron instance when using `Cron.make` or `Cron.parse`.

## Context.Reference

You can now create a `Context.Tag` that also has a default value.

```ts
import { Context } from "effect"

export class SpecialNumber extends Context.Reference<SpecialNumber>()(
  "SpecialNumber",
  { defaultValue: () => 2048 }
) {}

```

## Micro runtime changes

Micro execution is now using a fiber-runtime based model. This results in the following benefits:

- Improved performance
- Improved interruption model
- Consistency with the Effect data type

`Env` & `EnvRef` have been removed in favour of `Context.Reference`.

## Effect.scopedWith

`Effect.scopedWith` allows you to create & use a `Scope` without adding it to the Effect's requirements.

```ts
import { Effect, Scope } from "effect"

Effect.scopedWith((scope) => Scope.addFinalizer(scope, Effect.log("finalized")))
```

## BigDecimal updates

- `BigDecimal.toExponential` added - format a BigDecimal as a string in exponential notation.
- `BigDecimal.fromNumber` has been deprecated in favour of `BigDecimal.unsafeFromNumber`.

## Other changes

There were several other smaller changes made. Take a look through the CHANGELOG to see them all: [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/effect/CHANGELOG.md).

The next endpoint we're going to migrate is one that lists all of the users in a
database. For illustrative purposes, we're going to use SQLite using Bun's
built-in connector, but the technique we'll cover will work for
whatever database you're using, and however you're connecting to it.

First, let's take a look at our app in full with our new endpoint added to
it:

```ts twoslash {8-9,13-17} title=index.ts
import express from "express"

import { HttpRouter, HttpServer, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");

const app = express();

app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all(),
  });
});

export const health = Effect.sync(() => {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
})

const router = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/health", health),
)

NodeRuntime.runMain(
  Layer.launch(
    Layer.provide(
      HttpServer.serve(router),
      NodeHttpServer.layer(() => createServer(app), { port: 3000 }),
    ),
  ),
)
```

Before we continue, I'm going to make a modification to this since we learned
about `pipe` in the previous section. We can replace the expression at the
bottom of the file with this:

```ts twoslash title=index.ts
import express from "express"

import { HttpRouter, HttpServer, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");

const app = express();

app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all(),
  });
});

export const health = Effect.sync(() => {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
})

const router = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/health", health),
)
//---cut---
HttpServer.serve(router).pipe(
  Layer.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer(() => createServer(app), { port: 3000 })),
  Layer.launch,
  NodeRuntime.runMain
)
```

If `pipe` isn't quite clicking for you yet, one way to visualise it is that
you're passing some data through a sequence of functions.

Take this example:

```ts twoslash
import { pipe } from "effect"

const add = (x: number) => (y: number) => y + x;
const mul = (x: number) => (y: number) => y * x;
const sub = (x: number) => (y: number) => y - x;

const result = pipe(
  1,
  add(2),
  mul(3),
  sub(1)
)
console.log(result)
//=> 8
```

`add`, `mul`, and `sub` are all functions that return functions. So `add(2)`
returns a function that can add 2 to a given number: `add(2)(1)` returns 3.
Our pipeline starts with 1, then passes it through `add(2)`, `mul(3)`, and
`sub(1)`, resulting in 8.

One of the powers this gives you is the ability to add things easily into
the pipeline.

```ts twoslash
import { pipe } from "effect"

const add = (x: number) => (y: number) => y + x;
const mul = (x: number) => (y: number) => y * x;
const sub = (x: number) => (y: number) => y - x;
const log = (s: string) => (y: number) => {
  console.log(s, y);
  return y;
};

const result = pipe(
  1,
  add(2),
  log("1 + 2 ="),
  mul(3),
  log("  * 3 ="),
  sub(1),
  log("  - 1 ="),
);
```

This prints the following, with `result` still being 8:

```
1 + 2 = 3
  * 3 = 9
  - 1 = 8
```

As we migrate more complex endpoints, we'll see how this ability to "tap into"
the pipeline is really useful.

## Creating our data

To create our example `sqlite.db` file, make sure you have the `sqlite3` CLI
command installed. You can this either by downloading binaries from the
[official website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or by using a package
manager like `brew` on macOS or `apt` on Ubuntu.

```shell
$ sqlite3 sqlite.db
sqlite> CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT);
sqlite> INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ("Alice");
sqlite> INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ("Bob");
```

Then you can run the server with:

```shell
$ bun index.ts
```

And in another shell we can test the endpoint:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:3000/users
{"users":[{"id":1,"name":"Alice"},{"id":2,"name":"Bob"}]}⏎
```

## The direct approach

If we were to copy what we did with the `/health` endpoint, we'd end up with
code that looked like this:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter, HttpServer, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");
export const health = Effect.sync(() => {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
})
//---cut---
// @errors: 2379
const users = Effect.sync(() => {
  return HttpServerResponse.json({
    users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all(),
  })
})

const router = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/health", health),
  HttpRouter.get("/users", users),
)
```

This doesn't work, as we can see from the error. The reason is that
`HttpServerResponse.json` is an operation that might fail. Not all JavaScript
objects can be converted to JSON.

```ts twoslash
JSON.stringify({ big: 10n })
//=> TypeError: JSON.stringify cannot serialize BigInt.
```

For this reason, `HttpServerResponse.json` returns an `Effect` that can fail.
We didn't see this earlier because `HttpServerResponse.text` can't fail, and
so just returns an `HttpServerResponse` directly.

## Error handling in Effect

When we introduced the `Effect` type in the previous section, we dealt
exclusively with Effects that couldn't fail. That won't get us very far if
we're building anything non-trivial, so let's talk about error handling.

`Effect` is a generic type that takes 3 type arguments:

```typescript
Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>
```

`Success` is the type the Effect returns when it succeeds, `Error` is the type
it returns when it fails, and we'll talk about `Requirements` a bit later.

When we created our example Effects in the previous section, these all took on
the type `Effect<string, never, never>`.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
//---cut---
Effect.sync(() => "Hello, world!")
//=> Effect.Effect<string, never, never>
```

This means they will return a `string` on success, and never fail.

The Effect that `HttpServerResponse.json` returns is of type
`Effect<HttpServerResponse, HttpBodyError, never>`. So when we try to return
it from our `users` handler, we end up wrapping one Effect in another.

```ts twoslash
import { HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");
//---cut---
const users = Effect.sync(() => {
//    ^?
  return HttpServerResponse.json({
    users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all(),
  })
})
```

This is what the type error from earlier was trying to tell us. Here's the
error again:

```text wrap
Argument of type 'Effect<Effect<HttpServerResponse, HttpBodyError, never>, never, never>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Handler<never, never>'
```

Under the hood, a `Handler<never, never>` is an `Effect<HttpServerResponse,
never, never>`. Because `Effect<HttpServerResponse, HttpBodyError, never>` is
not an `HttpServerResponse`, the type checker gets upset with us.

It's possible to fix this with a call to `Effect.flatMap`:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");
//---cut---
const users = Effect.sync(() => {
  return Effect.flatMap(
    Effect.succeed({ users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all() }),
    HttpServerResponse.json,
  );
});
```

But it is more idiomatic in Effect to use `pipe`:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("sqlite.db");
//---cut---
const users = Effect.sync(() => {
  return {
    users: db.prepare("SELECT * FROM users").all(),
  };
}).pipe(Effect.flatMap(HttpServerResponse.json));
```

This no longer gives us a type error. We've split our computation into two
parts: fetching the data with `Effect.sync`, and serializing it with
`HttpServerResponse.json`. The `Effect.flatMap` in the middle of these two
takes care of the accidental `Effect` nesting.

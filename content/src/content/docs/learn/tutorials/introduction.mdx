In this tutorial we're going to migrate an Express.js app to Effect. We'll learn
how to configure your existing Express.js codebase to allow migrating endpoints
one at a time, adopting Effect incrementally. We'll start with the base set of
Effect concepts you'll need to migrate the simplest endpoint possible, and we'll
introduce new concepts as we migrate more complex endpoints.

## Our Express.js app

We'll start with a simple Express.js app that has a single health checking
endpoint.

```ts twoslash
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.type("text/plain").send("ok")
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000")
})
```

Create a new TypeScript project using your favourite package manager. I'm using
`bun`:

```shell
mkdir express-to-effect
cd express-to-effect
bun init
```

Save our Express.js app into `index.ts` and run it to make sure it works:

```shell
bun add express
bun run index.ts
```

You should see `Server is running on http://localhost:3000` in your terminal,
and visiting `http://localhost:3000/health` should return `ok`.

We are thrilled to announce the release of a brand new command-line tool for the Effect-TS ecosystem - `create-effect-app`! 

This handy tool streamlines the process of setting up new Effect projects, allowing you to quickly bootstrap either an official Effect example or a project template with Effect and all our recommended developer tooling pre-configured.

## Why `create-effect-app`?

Setting up a new Effect project can involve several steps, including creating folders, installing dependencies, and configuring tools. `create-effect-app` eliminates the boilerplate, allowing you to worry less about project configuration and focus instead on writing application code. 

## How to Use 

### Interactive Usage

To get started, simply run the `create-effect-app` command in your terminal using your preferred package manager:

**npm**

```sh
# npm
npx create-effect-app@latest
# pnpm
pnpm create effect-app@latest
# yarn
yarn create effect-app@latest
# bun
bunx create-effect-app@latest
```

This will launch an interactive setup process, guiding you through the steps needed to bootstrap your project:

Once you've made your selections, `create-effect-app` will create your new Effect project and configure it according to the preferences you selected.

### Non-Interactive Usage

If you prefer to use `create-effect-app` non-interactively, that is also supported:

```sh
create-effect-app 
  (-t, --template basic | cli | monorepo) 
  [--changesets] 
  [--flake] 
  [--eslint] 
  [--workflows] 
  [<project-name>]
create-effect-app 
  (-e, --example http-server) 
  [<project-name>]
```

Let's break down each of the options available to customize an Effect project template:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--changesets` | Initializes your project with the Changesets package for managing version control. |
| `--flake` | Initializes your project with a Nix flake for managing system dependencies. |
| `--eslint` | Includes ESLint for code formatting and linting. |
| `--workflows` | Sets up Effect's recommended GitHub Action workflows for automation. |

#### Example

For example, to create a new Effect project in a directory named `"my-effect-app"` with the basic template and ESLint integration, you can run:

```
$ npx create-effect-app --template basic --eslint my-effect-app
```

## Go Forth and Build

With `create-effect-app`, starting new Effect projects is easier than ever. Get building and explore the power of Effect!

## Help Us Improve

We're always looking for ways to improve the Effect-TS ecosystem. If you encounter any issues with create-effect-app or have feature requests, please don't hesitate to report them here:  https://github.com/Effect-TS/examples/issues/new

Happy Effecting!

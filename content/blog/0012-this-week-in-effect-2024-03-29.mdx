Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find our quick-start guide and documentation that will be your first step in your Effect journey. Enjoy!

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server reached **2130+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We just had our very first **[Effect Days Conference](/events/effect-days)** in Vienna on February 23, 2024. It's been an amazing experience connecting with our community in person. If you couldn't join us in Vienna, we've got plenty of exciting updates and content coming your way, so stay tuned!
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with our community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!

We've begun to release the talks from our speakers at the Effect Days Conference, and there's no better place to start than with [Johannes Schickling](https://twitter.com/schickling)'s outstanding Opening Keynote!
This video swiftly garnered massive attention on YouTube, and we're re-sharing it here for those who might have overlooked it:

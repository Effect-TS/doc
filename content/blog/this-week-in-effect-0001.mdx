Hi Effecters, and welcome to the very first **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**). 

We’re so proud to present you this new format that we conceived to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find our quick-start guide and documentation that will be your first step in your Effect journey. Enjoy!

Effect docs (https://effect.website/docs/introduction)

## Overview of TWIE

Before we get into what happened in the last week in our Community, let’s spend a few words about TWIE. 

We’re happy to witness the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect, and we understand  that it might not be that easy keeping up  with everything that is going on around the Effect Ecosystem:

our Discord server reached 1800+ members a few days ago, and the engagement is at an all-time high;

we’re approaching our very first Effect Days Conference in Vienna on Feb 23 (https://effect.website/events/effect-days), and a lot of new content is coming up;

all projects around Effect are receiving key updates, and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub too.

So, we wanted to make it easy for all our users to find all the info they need to fully enjoy their Effect journey

And that’s why we created TWIE: a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

In this way, we want to help you stay on track with everything that is going on and fully and being an active member of our community.

So, let’s start!

## Technology

Lists all the features, bugfixes, and changes (sometimes breaking) of this week

### General Chores

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2019

This adds provenance for publishing packages: https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements

### Effect Core

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2004 (Documentation)

Add jsdoc documentation for Effect.intoDeferred

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2007 (Optimization)

Improves performance of computing a FiberId hash by caching the computation

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1995 (Breaking, in next minor)

Use TimeoutException for timeout, previously timeout used NoSuchElementException and it proved to be prone for errors as functions such as optionFromOptional recover such exception

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2023 (Breaking, in next minor)

Makes Equal.Equal and Hash implicit traits and removes the Data.Data type that made types more complex for no specific safety gain as extending Equal doesn't necessarily mean that the equality is by value. The value level behaviour of Data is unchanged but it now returns more clean Readonly types.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2024 (Breaking, in next minor)

Improves naming of the ReadonlyRecord module, namely it renames upsert to set and update to replace , it also adds a new function add that can be used to add an entry to a record.

### Effect Schema

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1996 (Update Readme)

Adds a new section to the project readme that explains the annotations feature by showing how to customize generation of `Arbitrary<A>` instances.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2005 (DX Improvement)

Reorganizes overloads in Schema.optional to improve development experience when specifying defaults.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2017 (Bug Fix)

Improves generation of Equivalence supporting cases where schemas includes transformations.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2011 (Improvement)

Add option to preserve excess properties when parsing, the feature is described in detail in the issue: https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/issues/2008

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2026 (Breaking, in next minor)

Swaps the order of type parameters to simplify explicit type definitions, namely `Schema<R, I, A>` becomes `Schema<A, I = A, R = never>` this change also enables us to specify defaults for type parameters.

### Effect Platform

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1999 (Bug Fix)

Ensuring that fibers forked in uninterruptible regions are able to be interrupted.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2020 (Improvement)

Use Proxy for platform schema Transferable

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2016 

Adds support for URL objects in HTTP Client

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2025 (Breaking, in next minor)

Removes re-exports from platform-x packages and improves naming of specialized modules, generic modules like HttpClient can now be imported only from @effect/platform and specific modules like NodeRuntime can be imported from the specific platform package, in this case @effect/platform-node.

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2027 (Breaking, in next minor)

Fixes encoding of Transferable schemas, breaking because it includes a type-level change.

### Effect Experimental

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1999 (Bug Fix)

Ensuring that fibers forked in layers for background work are interruptible regardless of the regions they are forked in.

### Effect CLI

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2001 (Bug Fix)

Ensures proper error reporting when a single input is provided to a variadic option, priorly the check was silently skipped

https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2003 (Update Readme)

Fixes the README to update:

introduction of the executable parameter, CLI no longer needs to slice `process.argv` and automatically deals with executable path.

adds missing `Args` from the README example.

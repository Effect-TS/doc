Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find our quick-start guide and documentation that will be your first step in your Effect journey. Enjoy!

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server reached **2000+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We just had our very first **[Effect Days Conference](/events/effect-days)** in Vienna on February 23, 2024. It's been an amazing experience connecting with our community in person. If you couldn't join us in Vienna, we've got plenty of exciting updates and content coming your way, so stay tuned!
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with our community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!

Our [Effect Days](/events/effect-days) were spectacular! 

Reflecting on the past week, we're filled with gratitude for the incredible experience we've had! We want to extend a massive THANK YOU to all the attendees, speakers, workshop instructors, and everyone who contributed to making this event possible. Your enthusiasm and support have been truly inspiring!

We want to give a special shoutout to [Sebastian Lorenz](https://twitter.com/thefubhy) and [Nik Graf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf) for their tireless efforts in organizing and executing this intense three-day event. Thank you for making our vision a reality!

To ensure that everyone in our community can experience the excitement of Effect Days, we'll be sharing recordings of the conference talks on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts) in the coming weeks and the workshop sessions in the next few months.

### Community Day

On Saturday, February 23rd, we engaged in an intense laser tag session, with thrilling battles unfolding on the battlefield, resulting in a few victorious champions and one honorable casualty.

After the laser tag battles, peace was restored, and the day continued with a city tour. We had the chance to explore the vibrant center of Vienna, soaking in its rich history and culture, and spending valuable time together as a community.

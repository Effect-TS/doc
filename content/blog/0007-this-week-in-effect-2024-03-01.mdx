Hi Effecters! 

Welcome to the first Special Edition of **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem. And this week comes with some juicy news from our event in Vienna! 

We apologize for not publishing TWIE last week, but since we had our Conference on Friday, the 23rd, we wanted to give you the best update possible instead of rushing something with the event still ongoing. So to make you forgive us, this post will cover all the changes, news, and contents of the last two weeks!

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find our quick-start guide and documentation that will be your first step in your Effect journey. Enjoy!

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here's a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to witness the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect, and we understand that it might not be that easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server **reached 1970+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We just had our very first **[Effect Days Conference](/events/effect-days)** in Vienna on February 23, 2024, it has been an amazing occasion to meet our community, and we're preparing a lot of contents to update you on all the announcements and to make you part of the event even if you were not there.
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub.

So, we wanted to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

In this way, we want to help you stay on track with everything happening in the Effect Ecosystem and actively engage with our community.

Now, back to business!

### Effect Days Recap

Our [Effect Days](/events/effect-days) were spectacular! 

One of the most thrilling experiences we ever had. So, the first thing we want to do is to say a gigantic **THANK YOU** to all the attendees, the speakers, the tutors, and all the amazing people who made this event possible.

We would like to extend a special thank to [Nik](https://twitter.com/nikgraf) and [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/thefubhy), who worked day and night to allow us to set up such an incredible event that was far beyond our brightest expectations.

To let all the community to be part of and enjoy what the Effect Days had been, the workshops and the conference will be available for everybody on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts) in the next weeks. Stay in touch, because we also have some juicy extras for you.

Beginning with exciting news, we're thrilled to share two announcements that are sure to bring joy to many of you:
+ [Tim Smart](https://twitter.com/tim_smart) unveiled **a new VScode Extension** designed to empower every developer utilizing Effect with Telemetry & Metrics capabilities during their development process;
+ [Michael Arnaldi](https://twitter.com/MichaelArnaldi) has announced the imminent **release of the first release candidate**, scheduled to be launched within the coming days, with an estimated time frame of one month until the first **stable release of Effect**.

Now, getting into the event, we want to start with our awesome tutors. During their workshops on Thursday, the 22nd, we asked them a few questions about how to approach Effect as a newcomer. 

Check out their advice:

Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To begin your Effect journey, take a look at our quick-start guide and documentation below. Enjoy!

[Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)

[Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Effect became API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- Our community on Discord reached **2850+ members**!
- We're publishing new Effect Days talks every week. Make sure you don't miss any by subscribing to the [Efffect YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates**!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!


## Technology

[Effect 3.2](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.2) has been released. Read the full release post by [Tim Smart](https://x.com/tim_smart) to stay updated with all the latest features and improvements.

We also added a [Playground](https://effect.website/play) on our website to help everyone practising with Effect. Our team is working to enhance it and meet the community's needs, so we encourage you to reach out to us with any request or feedback.

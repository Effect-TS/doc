Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) – a weekly update to keep you in the loop with all the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

Get started with Effect with our quick-start guide and documentation below:

- [Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)
- [Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.6](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.6) has been released.
- Our [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) reached 3350+ members!
- All talks from Effect Days 2024 are available on the [Effect YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).


## Technology

+ For those who may have missed last week announcement, we introduced the [Effect Playground](https://effect.website/play), an interactive coding experience on Effect’s website for exploring API, with features like Monaco editor, file tree, terminal, and integration with Effect Developer Tools. Read the full [Effect Playground release post](https://effect.website/blog/playground-release) and happy coding!

### Picking a Place to Start

The first question one might ask when adopting Effect into an existing codebase is: "Where should I start?".

There are several valid answers to this question, but one of the easiest ways to get started is to consider any `await`-ed `Promise` a potential starting point. This is because Effect has excellent interop with `Promise`-based code.

Anywhere you previously did:

```ts

```

Our recommendation is to start by converting small, discrete, and self-contained pieces of code

one of the easiest ways to get started is to consider any `await`-ed `Promise` a candidate for Effect-ification.

Anywhere you previously did this:

```ts twoslash
declare const func: () => Promise<string>
const result = func()
```



Easiest to start by converting small parts of your application, for example a function that returns a promise

- Since Effect also allows you to properly model the error domain of your application, determine what errors are expected to be thrown by said function
- Determine the signature the function should return

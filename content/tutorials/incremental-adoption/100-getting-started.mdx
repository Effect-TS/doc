### Getting Started

When adopting Effect into an existing codebase, it's often best to start with discrete, self-contained pieces of code. You can then use features of Effect to easily interop with your existing code and gradually continue to adopt Effect at your own pace.

One of the easiest ways to get started is by replacing `Promise`-based code with Effect. This allows you to immediately benefit from the features of Effect, such as detailed error tracking and interruption.

### Refactoring from Promise

Let's say that in our application we have a function `getMessage` which takes a numeric `id` as a parameter and returns a `Promise<string>`. We want to re-implement all the logic inside `getMessage` with Effect.

```ts twoslash
declare function getMessage(id: number): Promise<string>

async function main() {
  const result = await getMessage(1)
}
```

Because Effect has excellent interop with `Promise`-based code, you can freely re-factor `getMessage` to use Effect and use `Effect.runPromise` elsewhere in your application where `getMessage` is `await`ed.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

declare function getMessage(id: number): Effect.Effect<string>

async function main() {
  const result = await Effect.runPromise(getMessage(1))
}
```

### Exercise

The team in charge of the `TodoRepository` has re-factored the `create` method. The method now returns an `Effect<Todo>` instead of a `Promise<Todo>`.

Using what we have learned above, your tasks for this exercise include:

  - Fix all type errors within the `POST /todos` route of our Express API
  - Ensure that the Express API responds with the created `Todo` as JSON

In the editor to the right, modify the code to restore functionality to our server.

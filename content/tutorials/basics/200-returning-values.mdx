title: Returning values
---

Congratulations on running your first Effect!

Next, let's take a look at the different ways you can return values from your
Effects.

### Effect.succeed

To create an effect that returns the same value everytime, you can use the
`Effect.succeed` constructor. It takes a value as input and produces an effect
that succeeds with that value. Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.succeed(42)
```

This effect will always succeed with the value `42`.

### Effect.sync

If you want to create an effect that runs a synchronous function for each run,
you can use the `Effect.sync` constructor. It takes a function as with no
arguments as input, and calls the function for each run. Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.sync(() => Date.now())
```

This effect will return the current date each time. Note that if we used
`Effect.succeed(Date.now())` instead, the date would be fixed to the time when
the effect was created.

### Effect.promise

If you want to create an effect from an asynchronous function that returns a
Promise, you can use the `Effect.promise` constructor. The resulting effect will
resolve the returned Promise and succeed with the value. Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.promise(() => fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat'))
```

This effect will fetch the GitHub user `octocat` and succeed with the response.

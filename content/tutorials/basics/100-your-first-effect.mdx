### What is an Effect?

The `Effect` type represents an immutable value that lazily describes a workflow
or job.

In some ways you can think of them like lazy Promise's - but Effects are not
actually Promise's, of course. They can model synchronous, asynchronous,
concurrent, and resourceful computations.

To get started, let's implement a "Hello world!" program! In the editor you can
see an example of the `Effect.log` function. This effect will log a message to
the console.

But how do we run it?

### Running Effect's

If you type `Effect.run` into the editor, you will see several different options
to choose from.

Similar to calling a function, to run an Effect we need to explicitly run it.
For this example let's try running the `Effect.log` effect with the
`Effect.runPromise` function.

To use `Effect.runPromise`:

```ts
Effect.runPromise(/* your effect goes here */)
```

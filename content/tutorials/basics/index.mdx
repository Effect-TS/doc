Welcome to the Effect tutorials!

### What is Effect?

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers easily create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs.

The benefits include:

- Maximum Type-safety (incl. error handling)
- Makes your code more composable, reusable and testable
- Extensive library with a rich ecosystem of packages
- Clustering and Workflows (Alpha)

### How to use this tutorial

To the right is an editor & console window. As you make changes to the code in the editor, the program will re-run and show the output in the console.

Each section will present an exercise designed to illustrate a feature. Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu above.

If you want to view the recommended solution to an exercise, click the "Solve" button.

title: Combining Effects
excerpt: Learn the basics of Effect

Now that you can create and run effects, let's take a look at how you can
combine them together.

### Effect.andThen

To combine two effects together, you can use `Effect.andThen`. It can be used
inside a `pipe` to run the first effect, and then run another effect if the
first one succeeds. Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.succeed(42).pipe(
  Effect.andThen((value) => Effect.succeed(value * 2))
)
```

The result of this effect will be the equivilent of `Effect.succeed(42 * 2)`.

### Effect.tap

If you want to combine two effects together without altering the return value,
you can use `Effect.tap`. Like `Effect.andThen`, it can be used in a pipeline.
Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.succeed(42).pipe(
  Effect.tap((value) => Effect.log(value))
)
```

The result of this effect will be `42`, which will additionally be logged to the console.

### Exercise

Using `Effect.andThen` & `Effect.tap`, complete the TODOs in the editor.

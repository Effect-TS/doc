title: Combining Effects
excerpt: Learn the basics of Effect

Now that you can create and run effects, let's take a look at how you can
combine them together.

### Effect.andThen

To combine two effects together, you can use `Effect.andThen`. It can be used
inside a `pipe` to run the first effect, and then run another effect if the
first one succeeds. Here's an example:

```ts
Effect.succeed(42).pipe(
  Effect.andThen((value) => Effect.succeed(value * 2))
)
```

The result of this effect will be the equivilent of `Effect.succeed(84)`.

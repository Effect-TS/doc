# Glossary

## Dual (API)

In the context of APIs, "dual" refers to a function that supports both the "data-first" and "data-last" variants.
It means that the API can be used interchangeably with either style, depending on the developer's preference.

One example of a dual API is the `map` function of the `Effect` data type.

In the "data-first" variant, the effect is passed as the first argument to `map`:

```ts
Effect.map(Effect.succeed(1), (n) => n + 1)
```

while in the "data-last" variant, the effect is passed as the first argument to the `pipe` function, followed by the `map` function:

```ts
pipe(
  Effect.succeed(1),
  Effect.map((n) => n + 1)
)
```

## Pipeline (of Effects)

A "pipeline" refers to a series of sequential operations performed on `Effect` values to achieve a desired result.
When working with `Effect`, a pipeline typically consists of operations such as mapping, flat-mapping, filtering, and error handling, among others. Each operation in the pipeline takes an input `Effect` and produces an output `Effect`, which becomes the input for the next operation in the sequence.

## Expected Errors

Also referred to as _failures_, _typed errors_ or _recoverable errors_.

These are errors that developers anticipate and expect as part of normal program execution.
Expected errors are tracked at the type level by the `Effect` data type in the "Error" channel:

```ts /Error/
Effect<Context, Error, Value>
```

## Unexpected Errors

Also referred to as _defects_, _untyped errors_, or _unrecoverable errors_.

These are errors that occur unexpectedly and are not part of the intended program flow.

## Interruption

Interruption errors occur when the execution of a running fiber is deliberately interrupted.

## Local workflow

Things that execute within a single execution boundary.

## Distributed workflow

Things that may execute across multiple execution boundaries.

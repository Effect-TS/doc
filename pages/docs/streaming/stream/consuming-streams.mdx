# Consuming Streams

When working with streams, it's essential to understand how to consume the data they produce.
In this guide, we'll walk through several common methods for consuming streams.

## Using `runCollect`

To gather all the elements from a stream into a single `Chunk`, you can use the `Stream.runCollect` function.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/consuming-streams/runCollect.ts

```

## Using `runForEach`

Another way to consume elements of a stream is by using `Stream.runForEach`. It takes a callback function that receives each element of the stream. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/consuming-streams/runForEach.ts

```

In this example, we use `Stream.runForEach` to log each element to the console.

## Using a Fold Operation

The `Stream.fold` function is another way to consume a stream by performing a fold operation over the stream of values and returning an effect containing the result. Here are a couple of examples:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/consuming-streams/fold.ts

```

In the first example (`e1`), we use `Stream.runFold` to calculate the sum of all elements. In the second example (`e2`), we use `Stream.runFoldWhile` to calculate the sum but only until a certain condition is met.

## Using a Sink

To consume a stream using a Sink, you can pass the `Sink` to the `Stream.run` function. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/consuming-streams/Sink.ts

```

In this example, we use a `Sink` to calculate the sum of the elements in the stream.

# Operations

In this section, we'll explore some essential operations you can perform on streams. These operations allow you to manipulate and interact with stream elements in various ways.

## Tapping

Tapping is an operation that involves running an effect on each emission of the stream. It allows you to observe each element, perform some effectful operation, and discard the result of this observation. Importantly, the `Stream.tap` operation does not alter the elements of the stream, and it does not affect the return type of the stream.

For instance, you can use `Stream.tap` to print each element of a stream:

```ts
import { Stream, Console, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make(1, 2, 3).pipe(
  Stream.tap((n) => Console.log(`before mapping: ${n}`)),
  Stream.map((n) => n * 2),
  Stream.tap((n) => Console.log(`after mapping: ${n}`))
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
before mapping: 1
after mapping: 2
before mapping: 2
after mapping: 4
before mapping: 3
after mapping: 6
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 2, 4, 6 ]
}
*/
```

## Taking Elements

Another essential operation is taking elements, which allows you to extract a specific number of elements from a stream. Here are several ways to achieve this:

- `take`. To extract a fixed number of elements.
- `takeWhile`. To extract elements until a certain condition is met.
- `takeUntil`. To extract elements until a specific condition is met.
- `takeRight`. To extract a specified number of elements from the end.

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.iterate(0, (n) => n + 1)

// Using `take` to extract a fixed number of elements:
const s1 = Stream.take(stream, 5)
Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(s1)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
}
*/

// Using `takeWhile` to extract elements until a certain condition is met:
const s2 = Stream.takeWhile(stream, (n) => n < 5)
Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(s2)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
}
*/

// Using `takeUntil` to extract elements until a specific condition is met:
const s3 = Stream.takeUntil(stream, (n) => n === 5)
Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(s3)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
}
*/

// Using `takeRight` to extract a specified number of elements from the end:
const s4 = Stream.takeRight(s3, 3)
Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(s4)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 3, 4, 5 ]
}
*/
```

## Mapping

In this section, we'll explore how to transform elements within a stream using the `Stream.map` family of operations. These operations allow you to apply a function to each element of the stream, producing a new stream with the transformed values.

### Basic Mapping

The `Stream.map` operation applies a given function to all elements of the stream, creating another stream with the transformed values. Let's illustrate this with an example:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make(1, 2, 3).pipe(Stream.map((n) => n + 1))

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 2, 3, 4 ]
}
*/
```

### Effectful Mapping

If your transformation involves effects, you can use `Stream.mapEffect` instead. It allows you to apply an effectful function to each element of the stream, producing a new stream with effectful results:

```ts
import { Stream, Random, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make(10, 20, 30).pipe(
  Stream.mapEffect((n) => Random.nextIntBetween(0, n))
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 6, 13, 5 ]
}
*/
```

You can evaluate effects concurrently using the `{ concurrency: n }` option. It allows you to specify the number of concurrent running effects. The results are emitted downstream in the original order.

Let's write a simple page downloader that fetches URLs concurrently:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const getUrls = Effect.succeed(["url0", "url1", "url2"])

const fetchUrl = (url: string) =>
  Effect.succeed([
    `Resource 0-${url}`,
    `Resource 1-${url}`,
    `Resource 2-${url}`
  ])

const stream = Stream.fromIterableEffect(getUrls).pipe(
  Stream.mapEffect(fetchUrl, { concurrency: 4 })
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [
    [ "Resource 0-url0", "Resource 1-url0", "Resource 2-url0" ], [ "Resource 0-url1", "Resource 1-url1",
      "Resource 2-url1" ], [ "Resource 0-url2", "Resource 1-url2", "Resource 2-url2" ]
  ]
}
*/
```

### Stateful Mapping

The `Stream.mapAccum` operation is similar to `map`, but it transforms elements statefully and allows you to map and accumulate in a single operation. Let's see how you can use it to calculate the running total of an input stream:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const runningTotal = (
  stream: Stream.Stream<never, never, number>
): Stream.Stream<never, never, number> =>
  stream.pipe(Stream.mapAccum(0, (s, a) => [s + a, s + a]))

// input:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(runningTotal(Stream.range(0, 6)))).then(
  console.log
)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 ]
}
*/
```

### Mapping and Flattening

The `mapConcat` operation is akin to `Stream.map`, but it takes things a step further. It maps each element to zero or more elements of type `Iterable` and then flattens the entire stream. Let's illustrate this with an example:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const numbers = Stream.make("1-2-3", "4-5", "6").pipe(
  Stream.mapConcat((s) => s.split("-")),
  Stream.map((s) => parseInt(s))
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(numbers)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
}
*/
```

In this example, we take a stream of strings like `"1-2-3"` and split them into individual numbers, resulting in a flattened stream of integers.

### Mapping to a Constant Value

The `Stream.as` method allows you to map the success values of a stream to a specified constant value. This can be handy when you want to transform elements into a uniform value. Here's an example where we map all elements to the `null` value:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const numbers = Stream.range(1, 5).pipe(Stream.as(null))

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(numbers)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ null, null, null, null ]
}
*/
```

In this case, regardless of the original values in the stream, we've mapped them all to `null`.

## Filtering

The `Stream.filter` operation is like a sieve that lets through elements that meet a specified condition. Think of it as a way to sift through a stream and keep only the elements that satisfy the given criteria. Here's an example:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.range(1, 11).pipe(Stream.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0))

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
}
*/
```

In this example, we start with a stream of numbers from 1 to 10 and use `Stream.filter` to retain only the even numbers (those that satisfy the condition `n % 2 === 0`). The result is a filtered stream containing the even numbers from the original stream.

## Scanning

In this section, we'll explore the concept of stream scanning. Scans are similar to folds, but they provide a historical perspective. Like folds, scans also involve a binary operator and an initial value. However, what makes scans unique is that they emit every intermediate result as part of the stream.

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.range(1, 6).pipe(Stream.scan(0, (a, b) => a + b))

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 ]
}
*/
```

In this example, we have a stream of numbers from 1 to 5, and we use `Stream.scan` to perform a cumulative addition starting from an initial value of 0. The result is a stream that emits the accumulated sum at each step: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.

Streams scans provide a way to keep a historical record of your stream transformations, which can be invaluable for various applications.

Additionally, if you only need the final result of the scan, you can use `Stream.runFold`:

```ts
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect"

const fold = Stream.range(1, 6).pipe(Stream.runFold(0, (a, b) => a + b))

Effect.runPromise(fold).then(console.log) // Output: 15
```

In this case, `Stream.runFold` gives you the final accumulated value, which is 15 in this example.

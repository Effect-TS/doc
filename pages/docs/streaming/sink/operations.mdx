# Sink Operations

In the previous sections, we learned how to create and use sinks. Now, let's explore some operations you can perform on sinks to transform or filter their behavior.

## Changing the Input

Sometimes, you have a sink that works perfectly with one type of input, but you want to use it with a different type. This is where `Sink.mapInput` comes in handy. While `map` modifies the output of a function, `mapInput` modifies the input. It allows you to adapt your sink to work with a different input.

Imagine you have a `Sink.sum` that calculates the sum of incoming numeric values. However, your stream contains strings, not numbers. You can use `mapInput` to convert your strings into numbers and make `Sink.sum` compatible with your stream:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/operations/mapInput.ts

```

## Transforming Both Input and Output

If you need to change both the input and output of a sink, you can use `Sink.dimap`. It's an extended version of `mapInput` that lets you transform both types. This can be useful when you need to perform a complete conversion between your input and output types:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/operations/dimap.ts

```

## Filtering Input

Sinks offer a way to filter incoming elements using `Sink.filterInput`. This allows you to collect or process only the elements that meet a specific condition. In the following example, we collect elements in chunks of three and filter out the negative numbers:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/operations/filterInput.ts

```

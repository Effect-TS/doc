# Creating Sinks

In the world of streams, sinks are used to consume and process the elements of a stream. Here, we will introduce some common sink constructors that allow you to create sinks for specific tasks.

## Common Constructors

### head

The `head` sink creates a sink that captures the first element of a stream. If the stream is empty, it returns `None`.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/head.ts

```

### last

The `last` sink consumes all elements of a stream and returns the last element of the stream.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/last.ts

```

### count

The `count` sink consumes all elements of the stream and counts the number of elements fed to it.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/count.ts

```

### sum

The `sum` sink consumes all elements of the stream and sums incoming numeric values.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/sum.ts

```

### take

The `take` sink takes the specified number of values from the stream and results in a [`Chunk`](../../data-types/chunk.mdx) data type.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/take.ts

```

### drain

The `drain` sink ignores its inputs, effectively discarding them.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/drain.ts

```

### timed

The `timed` sink executes the stream and measures its execution time, providing the duration.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/timed.ts

```

### forEach

The `forEach` sink executes the provided effectful function for every element fed to it.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/forEach.ts

```

## From Success and Failure

In the realm of data streams, similar to crafting streams to hold and manipulate data, we can also create sinks using the `Sink.fail` and `Sink.succeed` functions.

### Succeeding Sink

Let's start with a sink that doesn't consume any elements from its upstream but instead succeeds with a numeric value:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/succeed.ts

```

### Failing Sink

Now, consider a sink that also doesn't consume any elements from its upstream but deliberately fails, generating an error message of type `string`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/fail.ts

```

## Collecting

### Collecting All Elements

To gather all the elements from a data stream into a [`Chunk`](../../data-types/chunk.mdx), you can employ the `Sink.collectAll()` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAll.ts

```

### Collecting into a HashSet

If you want to accumulate the elements into a `HashSet`, you can use `Sink.collectAllToSet()`. This function ensures that each element appears only once in the resulting set:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllToSet.ts

```

### Collecting into a HashMap

For more advanced collection needs, you can use `Sink.collectAllToMap()`. This function allows you to accumulate and merge elements into a `HashMap<K, A>` using a specified merge function. In the following example, we determine map keys with `(n) => n % 3` and merge elements with the same key using `(a, b) => a + b`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllToMap.ts

```

### Collecting a Specified Number

If you only want to collect a specific number of elements from a stream into a [`Chunk`](../../data-types/chunk.mdx), you can use `Sink.collectAllN(n)`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllN.ts

```

### Collecting While Meeting a Condition

To accumulate elements as long as they satisfy a specific condition, you can use `Sink.collectAllWhile(predicate)`. This function will keep gathering elements until the predicate returns `false`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllWhile.ts

```

### Collecting into HashSets of a Specific Size

For more controlled collection into sets with a maximum size of `n`, you can utilize `Sink.collectAllToSetN(n)`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllToSetN.ts

```

### Collecting into HashMaps with Limited Keys

If you need to accumulate elements into maps with a maximum of `n` keys, you can employ `Sink.collectAllToMapN(n, keyFunction, mergeFunction)`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/collectAllToMapN.ts

```

## Folding

### Folding Left

Imagine you have a stream of numbers, and you want to reduce them into a single value by applying an operation to each element sequentially. You can achieve this using the `Sink.foldLeft` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/foldLeft.ts

```

### Folding with Termination

In some cases, you may want to fold elements in a stream but stop the folding process when a certain condition is met. This is called "short-circuiting." You can achieve this using the `Sink.fold` function, which allows you to specify a termination predicate:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/fold.ts

```

### Folding with Weighted Elements

Sometimes, you may want to fold elements based on their weight or cost, accumulating them until a certain maximum cost is reached. You can do this using `Sink.foldWeighted`. In the following example, we group elements based on a weight of 1, restarting the folding process when the total weight reaches 3:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/foldWeighted.ts

```

### Folding Until a Limit

If you want to fold elements up to a specific limit, you can use `Sink.foldUntil`. In the following example, we fold elements until we have accumulated 3 of them:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/sink/creating/foldUntil.ts

```

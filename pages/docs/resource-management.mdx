# Resource Management

The `Scope` data type is fundamental for managing resources safely and in a composable manner in Effect.

In simple terms, a scope represents the lifetime of one or more resources. When a scope is closed, the resources associated with it are guaranteed to be released.

By combining `Scope` with the Effect context, we gain a powerful way to manage resources effectively.

## Defining Resources

We can define a resource using operators like `Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release){:ts}`, which allows us to create a scoped value from an `acquire` and `release` workflow.

For example, let's define a simple resource:

```ts filename="resource.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/resource.ts

```

Notice that the `acquireRelease` operator added a `Scope` to the context required by the workflow:

```ts /Scope/
Effect<Scope, Error, MyResource>
```

This indicates that the workflow needs a `Scope` to run and adds a finalizer that will close the resource when the scope is closed.

We can continue working with the resource for as long as we want by using `flatMap` or other Effect operators. For example, here's how we can read the contents:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/using-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/using-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Once we are done working with the resource, we can close the scope using the `Effect.scoped` operator. It creates a new `Scope`, provides it to the workflow, and closes the `Scope` when the workflow is finished.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.scoped/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scoped-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.scoped/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scoped-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `scoped` operator removes the `Scope` from the context, indicating that there are no longer any resources used by this workflow which require a scope.

We now have a workflow that is ready to run:

```ts
Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Resource acquired
content is lorem ipsum
Resource released
*/
```

## acquireUseRelease

The `Effect.acquireUseRelease(acquire, use, release){:ts}` function is a specialized version of the `acquireRelease` function that simplifies resource management by automatically handling the scoping of resources.

The main difference is that `acquireUseRelease` eliminates the need to manually call `Effect.scoped` to manage the resource's scope. It has additional knowledge about when you are done using the resource created with the `acquire` step. This is achieved by providing a `use` argument, which represents the function that operates on the acquired resource. As a result, `acquireUseRelease` can automatically determine when it should execute the release step.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `acquireUseRelease`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/acquireUseRelease.ts

```

## Pattern: Sequence of Operations with Compensating Actions on Failure

In certain scenarios, you might need to perform a sequence of chained operations where the success of each operation depends on the previous one. However, if any of the operations fail, you would want to reverse the effects of all previous successful operations. This pattern is valuable when you need to ensure that either all operations succeed, or none of them have any effect at all.

Effect offers a way to achieve this pattern using the `acquireRelease` function in combination with the `Exit` type. The `acquireRelease` function allows you to acquire a resource, perform operations with it, and release the resource when you're done. The [`Exit`](./data-types/exit) type represents the outcome of an effectful computation, indicating whether it succeeded or failed.

Let's go through an example of implementing this pattern. Suppose we want to create a "Workspace" in our application, which involves creating an S3 bucket, an ElasticSearch index, and a Database entry that relies on the previous two.

To begin, we define the domain model for the required [services](./context-management/services): `S3`, `ElasticSearch`, and `Database`.

```ts filename="Services.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/pattern/Services.ts

```

Next, we define the three create actions and the overall transaction (`make`) for the Workspace.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts filename="Workspace.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/pattern/Workspace.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts filename="Workspace.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/pattern/Workspace-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

We then create simple service implementations to test the behavior of our Workspace code.
To achieve this, we will utilize [layers](./context-management/layers) to construct test services.
These layers will be able to handle various scenarios, including errors, which we can control using the `FailureCase` type.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts filename="WorkspaceTest.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/pattern/WorkspaceTest.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts filename="Workspace.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/pattern/WorkspaceTest-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's examine the test results for the scenario where `FailureCase` is set to `undefined` (happy path):

```verbatim filename="Terminal"
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[Database] creating entry for bucket <bucket.name> and index <index.id>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Right",
  right: {
    id: "<entry.id>"
  }
}
```

In this case, all operations succeed, and we see a successful result with `right({ id: '<entry.id>' })`.

Now, let's simulate a failure in the `Database`:

```ts /"Database"/
const runnable = Workspace.make.pipe(
  Effect.provideLayer(layer),
  Effect.provideService(Failure, "Database")
)
```

The console output will be:

```verbatim filename="Terminal"
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[Database] creating entry for bucket <bucket.name> and index <index.id>
[ElasticSearch] delete index <index.id>
[S3] delete bucket <bucket.name>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Left",
  left: {
    _tag: "DatabaseError"
  }
}
```

You can observe that once the `Database` error occurs, there is a complete rollback that deletes the `ElasticSearch` index first and then the associated `S3` bucket. The result is a failure with `left(new DatabaseError())`.

Let's now make the index creation fail instead:

```ts /"ElasticSearch"/
const runnable = Workspace.make.pipe(
  Effect.provideLayer(layer),
  Effect.provideService(Failure, "ElasticSearch")
)
```

In this case, the console output will be:

```verbatim filename="Terminal"
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[S3] delete bucket <bucket.name>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Left",
  left: {
    _tag: "ElasticSearchError"
  }
}
```

As expected, once the `ElasticSearch` index creation fails, there is a rollback that deletes the `S3` bucket. The result is a failure with `left(new ElasticSearchError())`.

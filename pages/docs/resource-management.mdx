# Resource Management

The `Scope` data type is fundamental for managing resources safely and in a composable manner in Effect.

In simple terms, a scope represents the lifetime of one or more resources. When a scope is closed, the resources associated with it are guaranteed to be released.

By combining `Scope` with the Effect context, we gain a powerful way to manage resources effectively.

## Defining Resources

We can define a resource using operators like `Effect.acquireRelease(acquire, release){:ts}`, which allows us to create a scoped value from an `acquire` and `release` workflow.

For example, let's define a simple resource:

```ts filename="resource.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/resource.ts

```

Notice that the `acquireRelease` operator added a `Scope` to the context required by the workflow:

```ts /Scope/
Effect.Effect<Scope, Error, MyResource>
```

This indicates that the workflow needs a `Scope` to run and adds a finalizer that will close the resource when the scope is closed.

We can continue working with the resource for as long as we want by using `flatMap` or other Effect operators. For example, here's how we can read the contents:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/using-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/using-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Once we are done working with the resource, we can close the scope using the `Effect.scoped` operator. It creates a new `Scope`, provides it to the workflow, and closes the `Scope` when the workflow is finished.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.scoped/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/scoped-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.scoped/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/scoped-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `scoped` operator removes the `Scope` from the context, indicating that there are no longer any resources used by this workflow which require a scope.

We now have a workflow that is ready to run:

```ts
Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Resource acquired
content is lorem ipsum
Resource released
*/
```

## acquireUseRelease

The `Effect.acquireUseRelease(acquire, use, release){:ts}` function is a specialized version of the `acquireRelease` function that simplifies resource management by automatically handling the scoping of resources.

The main difference is that `acquireUseRelease` eliminates the need to manually call `Effect.scoped` to manage the resource's scope. It has additional knowledge about when you are done using the resource created with the `acquire` step. This is achieved by providing a `use` argument, which represents the function that operates on the acquired resource. As a result, `acquireUseRelease` can automatically determine when it should execute the release step.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `acquireUseRelease`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/resource-management/scope/acquireUseRelease.ts

```

# Unexpected Errors

Effect provides two functions that allow you to handle unexpected errors that may occur during the execution of your effects.

<Warning>
  There is no sensible way to recover from defects. The functions we're about to
  discuss should be used only at the boundary between Effect and an external
  system, to transmit information on a defect for diagnostic or explanatory
  purposes.
</Warning>

## catchAllDefect

The `catchAllDefect` operator allows you to recover from all defects using a provided function. Here's an example:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Cause from "@effect/io/Cause"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!") // Simulating a runtime error
  .pipe(
    Effect.catchAllDefect((defect) => {
      if (Cause.isRuntimeException(defect)) {
        return Effect.log(`RuntimeException defect caught: ${defect.message}`, {
          level: "Fatal",
        })
      }
      return Effect.log("Unknown defect caught.", { level: "Fatal" })
    })
  )

// We get an Exit.Success because we caught all defects
console.log(JSON.stringify(Effect.runSyncExit(program)))
/*
... level=FATAL fiber=#0 message="RuntimeException defect caught: Boom!"
{"_tag":"Success"}
*/
```

It's important to understand that `catchAllDefect` can only handle defects, not expected errors (such as those caused by `Effect.fail`) or interruptions in execution (such as when using `Effect.interrupt`).

A defect refers to an error that cannot be anticipated in advance, and there is no reliable way to respond to it. As a general rule, it's recommended to let defects crash the application, as they often indicate serious issues that need to be addressed.

However, in some specific cases, such as when dealing with dynamically loaded plugins, a controlled recovery approach might be necessary. For example, if our application supports runtime loading of plugins and a defect occurs within a plugin, we may choose to log the defect and then reload only the affected plugin instead of crashing the entire application. This allows for a more resilient and uninterrupted operation of the application.

## catchSomeDefect

The `catchSomeDefect` operator in Effect allows you to recover from specific defects using a provided partial function. Let's take a look at an example:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Cause from "@effect/io/Cause"
import * as Option from "@effect/data/Option"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!") // Simulating a runtime error
  .pipe(
    Effect.catchSomeDefect((defect) => {
      if (Cause.isIllegalArgumentException(defect)) {
        return Option.some(
          Effect.log(
            `Caught an IllegalArgumentException defect: ${defect.message}`,
            { level: "Fatal" }
          )
        )
      }
      return Option.none()
    })
  )

// Since we are only catching IllegalArgumentException
// we will get an Exit.Failure because we simulated a runtime error.
console.log(JSON.stringify(Effect.runSyncExit(program)))
// Output: {"_tag":"Failure", ... }
```

It's important to understand that `catchSomeDefect` can only handle defects, not expected errors (such as those caused by `Effect.fail`) or interruptions in execution (such as when using `Effect.interrupt`).

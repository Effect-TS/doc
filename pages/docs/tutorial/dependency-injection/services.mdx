# Managing Services

Up until now, we have been working with Effects that do not have any context. In the `Effect<R, E, A>` type, the `R` parameter has always been of type `never`.

In this tutorial you will learn:

- How to work with Effects that require a context
- How to create Effects that depend on a specific context
- How to provide that context to the Effect

## Creating a simple service

Let's start by creating a service for a random number generator.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Context from "@effect/data/Context"

interface Random {
  readonly next: () => Effect.Effect<never, never, number>
}

const Random = Context.Tag<Random>()
```

The code above defines an interface called `Random`, which represents our service.
It has a single method called `next` that returns a random number.

The `Random` value is what is referred to as a "Tag" in Effect.
It serves as a representation of the `Random` service and allows Effect to locate and use this service at runtime.

Conceptually, we can start building a mental model of the context of an Effect by thinking of it as a

```ts
Map<Tag, Service>
```

where the Tag acts as the "key" to the service implementation within the context.

<Idea>
  Naming the interface the same as the value makes it easier to import in
  TypeScript, so it's recommended that you name the interface the same as the
  related Tag.
</Idea>

## Using the service

Now that we have our service interface defined, let's see how we can use it by building a pipeline.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

const program: Effect.Effect<Random, never, void> = pipe(
  Random,
  Effect.flatMap((random) => random.next()),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
)
```

In the code above, we can observe that we are able to flat-map over the `Random` Tag as if it were an Effect itself.
This allows us to access the `next` method of the service within the `flatMap` callback.
We then use the `Effect.logInfo` utility to log the generated random number.

It's worth noting that the type of the `program` variable includes `Random` in the `R` type parameter:

```ts /Random/
Effect<Random, never, void>
```

This indicates that our program requires the `Random` service to be provided in order to execute successfully.

If we attempt to execute the effect without providing the necessary service:

```ts
Effect.runSync(program)
```

We will encounter a type-checking error similar to the following:

```
Argument of type 'Effect<Random, never, void>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Effect<never, never, void>'.
  Type 'Random' is not assignable to type 'never'.ts(2345)
```

To resolve this error and successfully execute the program, we need to provide an actual implementation of the `Random` service.

In the next section, we will explore how to implement and provide the `Random` service to our program, enabling us to run it successfully.

## Providing a service implementation

In order to provide an actual implementation of the `Random` service, we can utilize the `provideService` function.

```ts
const runnable: Effect.Effect<never, never, void> = pipe(
  program,
  Effect.provideService(
    Random,
    Random.of({
      next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()),
    })
  )
)

Effect.runSync(runnable)
```

In the code snippet above, we call the `program` that we defined earlier and provide it with an implementation of the `Random` service.
We use the `provideService` function to associate the `Random` service with its implementation, which is an object with a `next` method that generates a random number.

Notice that the `R` type parameter of the `runnable` effect is now `never`. This indicates that the effect no longer requires any context to be provided. With the implementation of the `Random` service in place, we are able to run the program without any further dependencies.

By calling `runSync(runnable)`, we execute the effect and observe the result.

## Optional services

There are situations where we may want to access a service implementation only if it is available.
In such cases, we can use the `serviceOption` function to handle this scenario.

```ts
import * as Option from "@effect/data/Option"

const program: Effect.Effect<never, never, void> = pipe(
  Effect.serviceOption(Random),
  Effect.flatMap((maybeRandom) =>
    Option.match(
      maybeRandom,
      // the service is not available, return a default value
      () => Effect.succeed(-1),
      // the service is available
      (random) => random.next()
    )
  ),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
)
```

In the code above, we can observe that the `R` type parameter of the `program` effect is `never`, even though we are working with a service. This allows us to access something from the context only if it is actually provided before executing this effect.

When we run the `program` effect without providing the `Random` service:

```ts
Effect.runSync(program)
// ...more output... message=-1
```

We see that the log message contains `-1`, which is the default value we provided when the service was not available.

However, if we provide the `Random` service implementation:

```ts
Effect.runSync(
  pipe(
    program,
    Effect.provideService(
      Random,
      Random.of({
        next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()),
      })
    )
  )
)
// ...more output... message=0.9957979486841035
```

We can observe that the log message now contains a random number generated by the `next` method of the `Random` service.

By using the `serviceOption` function, we can gracefully handle scenarios where a service may or may not be available, providing flexibility in our programs.

## Using multiple services

When we need to manage multiple services in our program, we can utilize the `Effect.all(...tags){:ts}` function.
By passing a tuple of tags, we can access the corresponding tuple of services:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Context from "@effect/data/Context"
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

interface Random {
  readonly next: () => Effect.Effect<never, never, number>
}

const Random = Context.Tag<Random>()

interface Logger {
  readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<never, never, void>
}

const Logger = Context.Tag<Logger>()

const program: Effect.Effect<Random | Logger, never, void> = pipe(
  Effect.all(Random, Logger),
  Effect.flatMap(([random, logger]) =>
    Effect.flatMap(random.next(), (randomNumber) =>
      logger.log(`${randomNumber}`)
    )
  )
)
```

In the code above, we define two service interfaces: `Random` and `Logger`. Each interface represents a different service with its own set of methods.

The `program` effect now has an `R` type parameter of `Random | Logger`, indicating that it requires both the `Random` and `Logger` services to be provided.

```ts /Random | Logger/
Effect.Effect<Random | Logger, never, void>
```

To execute the `program`, we need to provide implementations for both services:

```ts
const runnable = pipe(
  program,
  Effect.provideService(
    Random,
    Random.of({
      next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()),
    })
  ),
  Effect.provideService(
    Logger,
    Logger.of({
      log: Effect.logInfo,
    })
  )
)
```

Alternatively, instead of calling `provideService` multiple times, we can combine the service implementations into a single context:

```ts
const context: Context.Context<Random | Logger> = pipe(
  Context.empty(),
  Context.add(Random, Random.of({ next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()) })),
  Context.add(
    Logger,
    Logger.of({
      log: Effect.logInfo,
    })
  )
)
```

and then provide the entire context using the `provideContext` function:

```ts
const runnable = pipe(program, Effect.provideContext(context))
```

By providing the necessary implementations for each service, we ensure that the `runnable` effect can access and utilize both services when it is executed.

In the upcoming section, we will delve into the topic of [Layers](layers). Layers are powerful constructs for creating services and composing them together, enabling us to build complex dependency graphs that can be seamlessly provided to Effects.

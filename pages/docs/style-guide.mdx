# Style Guide

Effect style guide is a set of recommendations for writing Effect modules.

## Modules

Effect ecosystem consists of many modules. Always use **`import * as ...`**
to avoid name conflicts. Modules are like namespaces.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect";
import * as Either from "@effect/data/Either";
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";

// Effect.runCallback
// Either.fromNullable
// Schema.struct
```

Types and interfaces should be "namespaced" as well. You may think it's
verbose, but it's explicit, and the code written in this style will never clash.

```ts
Effect.Effect<SomeRequirement, SomeError, SomeResult>;
```

There is only one exception. Functions from module Function shall be used directly.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function";
```

## Errors

Define errors with `Error` suffix.

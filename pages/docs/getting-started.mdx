# Getting Started

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  Effect's docs are still very much a work in progress!

## Installation

The Effect ecosystem modules live under `@effect/*`. We also plan to re-export the most common modules under the `effect` package so you can install that directly.

```bash
npm install @effect/io
npm install @effect/data
```

You can find the full list on GitHub.

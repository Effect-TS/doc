# Getting Started

<Callout emoji="🚧">
  Effect's docs are still very much a work in progress!

## Installation

The Effect ecosystem modules live under `@effect/*`. We also plan to re-export the most common modules under the `effect` package so you can install that directly.

```bash
npm install @effect/io
npm install @effect/data
```

You can find [the full list on GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS) and in the [API Reference section](/docs/api-reference).

## Using effect in your project
Since effect is a collection of many different modules, it is a common pattern to create a `common.ts` file that exports the modules used from `@effect/*` as well as utility modules:

```ts
/** Export `@effect/*` modules */
export * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk";
export * as Context from "@effect/data/Context";
export * as Data from "@effect/data/Data";
export * as Option from "@effect/data/Option";
export * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect";
export * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";

/** Export `flow` and `pipe` separately */
export { flow, pipe } from "@effect/data/Function";

/** Export utility modules */
export * as Http from "./fetch";
export * as HTMLParser from "./html-parser";
```

Then you can use it as follows:

```ts
import { Effect, HTMLParser, Option, pipe } from "./common";
```

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Pay attention to avoid cyclical dependencies by not using the `common` module in any of the modules that it re-exports. Tools like `eslint` and `madge` may help you prevent this mistake.

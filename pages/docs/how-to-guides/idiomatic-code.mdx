# How to write idiomatic code

Effect style guide is a set of recommendations for writing Effect modules.

## Modules

Effect ecosystem consists of many modules. Always use **`import * as ...`**
to avoid name conflicts. Modules are like namespaces.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Either from "@effect/data/Either"
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema"

// Effect.runCallback
// Either.fromNullable
// Schema.struct
```

Types and interfaces should be "namespaced" as well. You may think it's
verbose, but it's explicit, and the code written in this style will never clash.

```ts
Effect.Effect<SomeRequirement, SomeError, SomeResult>
```

There is only one exception. Functions from module Function shall be used directly.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
```

## Writing Code with Effect

Nested callbacks are a common problem in JavaScript, and are often handled by using async/await in most modern JavaScript codebases. However, since we are working in the world of Effects, the available APIs are a bit different.

This section will cover the three common ways to organize Effectful code:

1. Using `pipe`

2. Using generators

3. Using the `Do` simulation

### Using pipe

The pipe function is a common way to organize Effectful code. It is a function that takes a value and a series of functions, and applies the functions to the value in order.

The pipe function is defined in the Effect library, and is available in the Effect namespace.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Random from "@effect/io/Random"

const example = pipe(
  Random.next(),
  Effect.flatMap((n) =>
    n > 0.5 ? Effect.succeed("yay!") : Effect.fail("oh no!")
  )
)
```

Here, `Random.next()` is getting piped as an argument to `Effect.flatMap`.

<Callout type="info">
  Many functions in Effect have `dual` APIs, which means that you can either
  call it `data-first` or `data-last`. Here, you can see how `Effect.flatMap` is
  _after_ the call to `Random.next()` in the `pipe`, so `Random.next()` is
  passed in last (i.e. `data-last`).

Similarly, you can also call
`Effect.flatMap(Random.next(), (n) => ...)` directly without `pipe` with
`Random.next()` as the first argument (i.e. `data-first`) and get the same
result.

</Callout>

### Using generators

Effect has a unique imperative API to solve for the problem of lots of nested callbacks when using functions like `pipe`. Instead of writing the code above, here's what it would look like if you were to write the same thing with the generator API.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Random from "@effect/io/Random"

const example = Effect.gen(function* ($) {
  const n = yield* $(Random.next())
  if (n > 0.5) {
    return yield* $(Effect.succeed("yay!"))
  } else {
    return yield* $(Effect.fail("oh no!"))
  }
})
```

Note the `yield*`, which is used to yield the next value from the generator. Additionally, one can also observe the `$` argument passed to `Effect.gen`, which is just a function that serves as an "adapter" that allows TypeScript to track our Effect types. When yielding an Effect, you must pass the Effect you would like to `yield*` to the adapter function to ensure that TypeScript can properly infer the types.

This way, you can write in a more imperative style rather than having to use `pipe` and `flatMap`.

<Callout type="info">
  The dollar sign is just an argument name convention and is not a special
  symbol in Effect. You are free to name it whatever you want (e.g. using an
  underscore, etc.). The current convention is to use `$` as the argument name.
</Callout>

#### Using the Adapter Argument as a `pipe`

One thing to note is that the `$` argument also can be used as a pipe function. In the following example, `Random.next()` is piped into `Effect.either`.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Random from "@effect/io/Random"
import * as Either from "@effect/data/Either"

const example = Effect.gen(function* ($) {
  const n = yield* $(Random.next(), Effect.either)
  if (Either.isRight(n)) {
    return yield* $(Effect.succeed("yay!"))
  } else {
    return yield* $(Effect.fail("oh no!"))
  }
})
```

### Using the `Do` simulation

To avoid nested pipes and generators, Effect has a `Do` function which can be used to simulate "do notation" in other languages.

<Callout type="info">
  If you are familiar with Haskell or Scala, you may be familiar with `Do`
  notation or Scala's `for` comprehensions. Effect has a similar API.
</Callout>

Here's what a slightly more complex version of the above example would look like if you were to use `Do`.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Random from "@effect/io/Random"
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

const example = pipe(
  Effect.Do(),
  Effect.let("randomValue", () => 3),
  Effect.bind("randomNumber", ({ randomValue }) => Random.next()),
  Effect.flatMap(({ randomNumber, randomValue }) =>
    randomNumber > 0.5 && randomValue > 1
      ? Effect.succeed("yay!")
      : Effect.fail("oh no!")
  )
)
```

<Callout type="info">
  Using `Effect.let` is similar to saving a variable to a value, while
  `Effect.bind` will unwrap an Effect similar to `Effect.flatMap`.
</Callout>

The strings passed to `bind` become keys in an object, and the values being the result on the right. When using these functions, notice how each successive function is passed the previous result, similar to if you had set a variable in the generator example above.

## Errors

Define errors with `Error` suffix.

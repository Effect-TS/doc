# The Effect Data Type

The `Effect` data type provides a type-safe representation of programs. It can be thought of as a function that takes a `Context` as input and, when executed, can either fail with an `Error` or succeed with a `Value`.

```ts
type Effect<Context, Error, Value> = (context: Context) => Either<Error, Value>
```

This mental model helps us understand the `Effect` type conceptually, but it's important to note that `Effect` is more powerful than just a function.

## Type Parameters

The `Effect` type has three type parameters with the following meanings:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Context`     | Represents the contextual data required by the `Effect` to be executed.       |
| `Error`       | Represents the expected errors that can occur when executing an `Effect`.     |
| `Value`       | Represents the type of value that an `Effect` can succeed with when executed. |

<Info>
  In the Effect ecosystem, you may often encounter the type parameters of
  `Effect` abbreviated as `R`, `E`, and `A` respectively. This is just shorthand
  for **R**equirements, **E**rror, and the success value of type **A**.
</Info>

Think of each of these type parameters as separate "channels" within the `Effect` data type. Your program can interact with each of these "channels" during its execution.

For example, an `Effect` with no requirements would have the type `Effect<never, _, _>` and can run under any circumstances. Similarly, an `Effect` that is guaranteed not to fail would have the type `Effect<_, never, _>`.

Effects are evaluated lazily, which means that creating a value of type `Effect` does not immediately execute the underlying code. To run the effects and execute the program, we need to bootstrap our components and configure the runtime environment. The `Effect` type offers strong compile-time guarantees that help us properly structure and organize dependencies.

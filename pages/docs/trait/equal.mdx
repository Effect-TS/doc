# Equal

The Equal module provides a simple and convenient way to define and check for equality between two values in TypeScript.

## Checking Equality

The main function in Equal for checking equality is `Equal.equals`.

By default, it uses the `===` operator to perform the comparison. Consider the following example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/equals-default.ts
import { Equal } from "effect"

const a = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
const b = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }

console.log(Equal.equals(a, b)) // Output: false
```

In this case, `a` and `b` are two separate objects that happen to have the same contents, but `===` considers them different because they occupy different memory locations.
This behavior can lead to unexpected results when you're trying to compare values based on their content rather than their memory addresses.

In JavaScript, we can't alter the behavior of the `===` operator. However, we have two alternative approaches to implement custom equality checks:

1. **Implementing the `Equal` Interface**: This method is useful when you need to define your custom equality check.

2. **Using the Data Module**: For simple value equality, the [Data](../data-types/data) module provides a more straightforward solution by automatically generating default implementations for `Equal`.

Let's delve into both solutions.

## Implementing the Equal Interface

To create custom equality behavior, you can implement the `Equal` interface in your models. This interface extends the `Hash` interface from the [Hash](hash) module. By implementing the `Equal` interface, you gain the ability to define a custom equality function for your objects.

Here's an example of implementing the `Equal` interface for a `Person` class:

```ts filename="Person.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/Person.ts
import { Equal, Hash } from "effect"

export class Person implements Equal.Equal {
  constructor(readonly name: string, readonly age: number) {}

  [Equal.symbol](that: Equal.Equal): boolean {
    if (that instanceof Person) {
      return (
        Equal.equals(this.name, that.name) && Equal.equals(this.age, that.age)
      )
    }
    return false
  }

  [Hash.symbol](): number {
    return this.name.length + this.age
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define a custom equality function `[Equal.symbol]` and a hash function `[Hash.symbol]` for the `Person` class. The `Hash` interface optimizes equality checks by comparing hash values instead of the objects themselves. When you use the `Equal.equals` function to compare two objects, it first checks if their hash values are equal. If not, it quickly determines that the objects are not equal, avoiding the need for a detailed property-by-property comparison.

Once you've implemented the `Equal` interface, you can utilize the `Equal.equals` function to check for equality using your custom logic. Here's an example using the `Person` class:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/equals-Person.ts
import { Equal } from "effect"
import { Person } from "./Person"

const alice = new Person("Alice", 30)
const bob = new Person("Bob", 40)

console.log(Equal.equals(alice, alice)) // Output: true
console.log(Equal.equals(alice, new Person("Alice", 30))) // Output: true

console.log(Equal.equals(alice, bob)) // Output: false
```

In this code, the equality check returns `true` when comparing `alice` to a new `Person` object with identical property values and `false` when comparing `alice` to `bob` due to their differing property values.

## Simplifying Equality with the Data Module

Implementing both `Equal` and `Hash` can become cumbersome when all you need is straightforward value equality checks. Luckily, the [Data](../data-types/data) module provides a simpler solution. It offers APIs that automatically generate default implementations for both `Equal` and `Hash`.

Let's see how it works:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/Data-struct.ts
import { Equal, Data } from "effect"

// $ExpectType Data<{ name: string; age: number; }>
const alice = Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })

// $ExpectType Data<{ name: string; age: number; }>
const bob = Data.struct({ name: "Bob", age: 40 })

console.log(Equal.equals(alice, alice)) // Output: true
console.log(Equal.equals(alice, Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }))) // Output: true

console.log(Equal.equals(alice, { name: "Alice", age: 30 })) // Output: false
console.log(Equal.equals(alice, bob)) // Output: false
```

In this example, we use the `Data.struct` function to create structured data objects and check their equality using `Equal.equals`. The [Data](../data-types/data) module simplifies the process by providing a default implementation for both `Equal` and `Hash`, allowing you to focus on comparing values without the need for explicit implementations.

The Data module isn't limited to just structs. It can handle various data types, including tuples, arrays, and records. If you're curious about how to leverage its full range of features, you can explore the [Data module documentation](../data-types/data).

## Working with Collections

JavaScript's built-in `Set` and `Map` can be a bit tricky when it comes to checking equality:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/set.ts
export const set = new Set()

set.add({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
set.add({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })

console.log(set.size) // Output: 2
```

Even though the two elements in the set have the same values, the set contains two elements. Why? JavaScript's `Set` checks for equality by reference, not by values.

To perform value-based equality checks, you'll need to use the `Hash*` collection types available in the `effect` package. These collection types, such as [`HashSet`](https://effect-ts.github.io/data/modules/HashSet.ts.html) and [`HashMap`](https://effect-ts.github.io/data/modules/HashMap.ts.html), also provide support for the `Equal` trait.

Let's take a closer look at how to use `HashSet` for value-based equality checks:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/hashset.ts
import { HashSet, Data } from "effect"

export const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
  HashSet.add(Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })),
  HashSet.add(Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }))
)

console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1
```

When you use the `HashSet`, it correctly handles value-based equality checks. In this example, even though you're adding two objects with the same values, the `HashSet` treats them as a single element.

**Note**: It's crucial to use elements that implement the `Equal` trait, either by implementing custom equality checks or by using the Data module. This ensures proper functionality when working with `HashSet`. Without this, you'll encounter the same behavior as the native `Set` data type:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/hashset-without-Data.ts
import { HashSet } from "effect"

export const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
  HashSet.add({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }),
  HashSet.add({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
)

console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 2
```

In this case, without using the Data module alongside `HashSet`, you'll experience the same behavior as the native `Set` data type. The set contains two elements because it checks for equality by reference, not by values.

When working with the `HashMap`, you have the advantage of comparing keys by their values instead of their references. This is particularly helpful in scenarios where you want to associate values with keys based on their content.

Let's explore this concept with a practical example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/trait/equal/hashmap.ts
import { HashMap, Data } from "effect"

const map = HashMap.empty().pipe(
  HashMap.set(Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }), 1),
  HashMap.set(Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }), 2)
)

console.log(HashMap.size(map)) // Output: 1

console.log(HashMap.get(map, Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 }))) // Output: some(2)
```

In this code snippet, we use the `HashMap` data structure to create a map where keys are objects created using `Data.struct`. These objects have the same values, which would typically result in multiple entries in a traditional JavaScript map.

However, with `HashMap`, the keys are compared by their values rather than their memory references. As a result, even though we add two objects with identical content as keys, the map correctly handles them as a single key-value pair.

To retrieve a value associated with a specific key, we can use `HashMap.get`. In this example, when we query the map with an object having the same values as the key, it returns the associated value, which is `2`.

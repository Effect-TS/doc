# Introduction to Effect's Control Flow Operators

Even though JavaScript provides built-in control flow structures, Effect offers additional control flow operators that are useful in Effect applications. In this section, we will introduce different ways to control the flow of execution.

## `if` Expression

When working with Effect values, we can use the standard JavaScript if-then-else expressions:

```ts
import { Effect, Option } from "effect"

const validateWeightOption = (
  weight: number
): Effect.Effect<never, never, Option.Option<number>> => {
  if (weight >= 0) {
    return Effect.succeed(Option.some(weight))
  } else {
    return Effect.succeed(Option.none())
  }
}
```

Here we are using the [`Option`](../data-types/option) data type to represent the absence of a valid value.

We can also handle invalid inputs by using the error channel:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const validateWeightOrFail = (
  weight: number
): Effect.Effect<never, string, number> => {
  if (weight >= 0) {
    return Effect.succeed(weight)
  } else {
    return Effect.fail(`negative input: ${weight}`)
  }
}
```

## Conditional Operators

### when

Instead of using `if (condition) expression`, we can use the `Effect.when` operator:

```ts
import { Effect, Option } from "effect"

const validateWeightOption = (
  weight: number
): Effect.Effect<never, never, Option.Option<number>> =>
  Effect.when(() => weight >= 0)(Effect.succeed(weight))
```

If the condition itself involves an effect, we can use `Effect.whenEffect`.

For example, the following function creates a random option of an integer value:

```ts
import { Effect, Random } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, Option.Option<number>>
const randomIntOption = Effect.whenEffect(Random.nextBoolean)(Random.nextInt)
```

The `Effect.when` and `Effect.whenEffect` operators allow us to conditionally execute effects based on a given predicate or an effectful predicate, respectively.

### unless

The `Effect.unless` and `Effect.unlessEffect` operators are similar to the `when*` operators, but they are the moral equivalent of the `if (!condition) expression` construct.

### if

The `Effect.if` operator allows you to provide an effectful predicate. If the predicate evaluates to `true`, the `onTrue` effect will be executed. Otherwise, the `onFalse` effect will be executed.

Let's use this operator to create a simple virtual coin flip function:

```ts
import { Effect, Random } from "effect"

const onTrue = Effect.log("Head")
const onFalse = Effect.log("Tail")

// Effect<never, never, void>
const flipTheCoin = Effect.if(Random.nextBoolean, { onTrue, onFalse })

Effect.runSync(flipTheCoin)
/*
... level=INFO fiber=#0 message=Head (or Tail)
*/
```

In this example, we generate a random boolean value using `Random.nextBoolean`. If the value is `true`, the effect `onTrue` will be executed, which logs "Head". Otherwise, if the value is `false`, the effect `onFalse` will be executed, logging "Tail".

## Loop Operators

### loop

The `Effect.loop` operator allows you to repeatedly change the state based on an `step` function until a condition given by the `cont` function is evaluated to `true`:

```ts
Effect.loop(initial, options: { while, step, body })
```

It collects all intermediate states in an array and returns it as the final result.

We can think of `Effect.loop` as a moral equivalent of a `while` loop in JavaScript:

```ts
let state = initial
const result = []

while (options.while(state)) {
  result.push(options.body(state))
  state = options.step(state)
}

return result
```

**Example**

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, number[]>
const result = Effect.loop(
  1, // Initial state
  {
    while: (n) => n <= 5, // Condition to continue looping
    step: (n) => n + 1, // State update function
    body: (n) => Effect.succeed(n), // Effect to be performed on each iteration
  }
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(result)) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, the loop starts with an initial state of `1`. The loop continues as long as the condition `n <= 5` is `true`, and in each iteration, the state `n` is incremented by `1`. The effect `Effect.succeed(n)` is performed on each iteration, collecting all intermediate states in an array.

You can also use the `discard` option if you're not interested in collecting the intermediate results. It discards all intermediate states and returns `undefined` as the final result.

**Example** (`discard: true`)

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const result = Effect.loop(
  1, // Initial state
  {
    while: (n) => n <= 5, // Condition to continue looping,
    step: (n) => n + 1, // State update function,
    body: (index) =>
      Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Currently at index ${index}`)), // Effect to be performed on each iteration,
    discard: true,
  }
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(result))
/*
Currently at index 1
Currently at index 2
Currently at index 3
Currently at index 4
Currently at index 5
undefined
*/
```

In this example, the loop performs a side effect of logging the current index on each iteration, but it discards all intermediate results. The final result is `undefined`.

### iterate

The `Effect.iterate` combinator allows you to iterate with an effectful operation. It uses an effectful `body` operation to change the state during each iteration and continues the iteration as long as the `cont` function evaluates to `true`.

```ts
Effect.iterate(initial, options: { while, body })
```

We can think of `Effect.iterate` as a moral equivalent of a `while` loop in JavaScript:

```ts
let result = initial

while (options.while(result)) {
  result = options.body(result)
}

return result
```

Here's an example of how it works:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, number>
const result = Effect.iterate(
  1, // Initial state
  {
    while: (n) => n <= 5, // Condition to continue iterating
    body: (n) => Effect.succeed(n + 1), // Operation to change the state
  }
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(result)) // Output: 6
```

### forEach

The `Effect.forEach` combinator allows you to iterate over an `Iterable` and perform an effectful operation for each element.
It applies the given effectful operation to each element of the `Iterable` sequentially.

Let's take a look at an example:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, number[]>
const result = Effect.forEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (index) =>
  Effect.sync(() => {
    console.log(`Currently at index ${index}`)
    return index * 2
  })
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(result))
/*
Currently at index 1
Currently at index 2
Currently at index 3
Currently at index 4
Currently at index 5
[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
*/
```

In this example, we have an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and for each element `index`, we perform an effectful operation. The output shows that the operation is executed for each element in the array, displaying the current index.

The `Effect.forEach` combinator collects the results of each effectful operation in an array, which is why the final output is `[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]`.

We also have the `discard` option, which when set to `true` discards the results of each effectful operation:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const result = Effect.forEach(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  (index) => Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Currently at index ${index}`)),
  { discard: true }
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(result))
/*
Currently at index 1
Currently at index 2
Currently at index 3
Currently at index 4
Currently at index 5
undefined
*/
```

In this case, the output is the same, but the final result is `undefined` since the results of each effectful operation are discarded.

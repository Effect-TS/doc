# Importing Effect

Welcome to Effect! If you're just getting started, you might feel overwhelmed by the variety of modules and functions that Effect offers.
However, rest assured that you don't need to worry about all of them right away.
In this guide, we will provide you with a simple orientation on how to import modules and functions and assure you that,
in most cases, installing the `effect` package is all you need to get started. Let's dive in!

## Installing Effect

To begin your journey with Effect, you first need to install the `effect` package. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install effect
```

By installing this single package, you gain access to the core functionality of Effect.

For more detailed installation instructions on other platforms like Deno or Bun, you can refer to the [Quickstart](../quickstart) tutorial.
This will provide you with step-by-step guidance to set up Effect on different environments.

## Importing Effect Modules and Functions

Once you have installed the `effect` package, you can start using its modules and functions in your projects.
Importing modules and functions is straightforward and follows the standard JavaScript/TypeScript import syntax.

To import a module or a function from the `effect` package, simply use the `import` statement at the top of your file. Here's how you can import the `Effect` module:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
```

Now, you have access to the `Effect` module, which is the heart of the `effect` library. It provides various functions and combinators to create, compose, and manipulate effectful computations.

## Commonly Used Functions

As you start your adventure with Effect, you don't need to dive into every function in the `effect` package right away. Instead, focus on some commonly used functions that will provide a solid foundation for your journey into the world of Effect.

In the upcoming guides, we will explore some of these essential functions, specifically those for creating and running `Effect`s and building pipelines.

But before we dive into those, let's start from the very heart of Effect: understanding the `Effect` type. This will lay the groundwork for your understanding of how Effect brings composability, type safety, and error handling into your applications.

So, let's take the first step and explore the fundamental concepts of the [The Effect Type](effect-type).

# Building Pipelines

Effect pipelines allow for the composition and sequencing of operations on values, enabling the transformation and manipulation of data in a concise and modular manner.

In this tutorial you will learn:

- How `pipe` works and how to use it.
- How `map` works with an example.
- How `flatMap` works with an example.
- How `all` works with an example.
- An example that combines all four functions to build a pipeline.

Let's get started!

## pipe

The `pipe` function is a utility that allows us to compose functions in a readable and sequential manner. It takes the output of one function and passes it as the input to the next function in the pipeline. This enables us to build complex transformations by chaining multiple functions together.

The basic syntax of `pipe` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

const result = pipe(input, func1, func2, ..., funcN)
```

In this syntax, `input` is the initial value, and `func1`, `func2`, ..., `funcN` are the functions to be applied in sequence. The result of each function becomes the input for the next function, and the final result is returned.

Here's an illustration of how `pipe` works:

```mermaid

  input([input]) --> func1 --> func2 --> ... --> funcN --> result([final result])
```

It's important to note that functions passed to `pipe` must have a **single argument** because they are only called with a single argument.

Let's see an example to better understand how `pipe` works:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1
const double = (x: number) => x * 2
const subtractTen = (x: number) => x - 10

const result = pipe(5, increment, double, subtractTen)

console.log(result) // Output: 2
```

In the above example, we start with an input value of `5`. The `increment` function adds `1` to the initial value, resulting in `6`. Then, the `double` function doubles the value, giving us `12`. Finally, the `subtractTen` function subtracts `10` from `12`, resulting in the final output of `2`.

## map

The `Effect.map` function is used to transform the value inside an `Effect`.
It takes a function and applies it to the value contained within the `Effect`, creating a **new** `Effect` with the transformed value.

<Info>
  It's important to note that `Effect`s are immutable, meaning that when you use
  `map` on an `Effect`, it doesn't modify the original data type. Instead, it
  returns a new copy of the `Effect` with the transformed value.
</Info>

The syntax for `map` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const mappedEffect = pipe(effect, Effect.map(func))
```

In the code above, `func` represents the transformation function to be applied, and `effect` is the input `Effect`.

Let's see an example to better understand how `map` works:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1

// Effect<never, never, number>
const mappedEffect = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(5),
  Effect.map((x) => increment(x))
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(mappedEffect)) // Output: 6
```

In the example above:

- We define a simple `increment` function that adds `1` to its input.
- We create an `Effect` using `Effect.succeed` with an initial value of `5`.
- We use `map` to apply the `increment` function to the value inside the `effect`.

The resulting `Effect` contains the transformed value of `6`.

## flatMap

In the previous example, we saw how to transform an `Effect` using the `map` function when the transformation function returns a regular value. But what if we want to transform an `Effect` using a function that itself returns another `Effect`?

The `Effect.flatMap` function allows us to chain computations that produce `Effect` values. It takes a transformation function that produces a new `Effect` and then "flattens" the nested `Effect` structure.

<Info>
  It's important to note that `Effect`s are immutable, meaning that when you use
  `flatMap` on an `Effect`, it doesn't modify the original data type. Instead,
  it returns a new copy of the `Effect` with the transformed value.
</Info>

The syntax for `flatMap` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const flatMappedEffect = pipe(effect, Effect.flatMap(func))
```

In the code above, `func` represents the transformation function that returns a new `Effect`, and `effect` is the input `Effect` that we want to transform.

Let's see an example to better understand how `flatMap` works:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

function divide(a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<never, Error, number> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
  }
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

// Effect<never, Error, number>
const flatMappedEffect = pipe(
  Effect.succeed([10, 2]),
  Effect.flatMap(([a, b]) => divide(a, b))
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(flatMappedEffect)) // Output: 5
```

In the example above:

- We define a function called `divide` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns an `Effect` that can potentially succeed with the result of the division or fail with an error if `b` is zero.
- We create an `Effect` using `Effect.succeed` with a tuple containing the values `10` and `2`.
- We use `flatMap` to apply the `divide` function to the values inside the `effect`.

The resulting `Effect` contains the transformed value of `5`.

When using `Effect.flatMap`, it is crucial to ensure that **all effects** are properly considered in the computation. If you ignore an effect returned by a computation within `flatMap`, it can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect program logic.

Let's take a look at the following code snippet:

```ts {2}
Effect.flatMap(([a, b]) => {
  Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Performing division: ${a} / ${b}`))
  return divide(a, b)
})
```

The problem here is that the effect returned by `Effect.sync` will be ignored and not included in the resulting computation. It will not be chained or combined with the effect returned by`divide(a, b)`. As a result, you may encounter unexpected program behavior and obtain incorrect results.

To ensure correct behavior, make sure that any effect you want to include in the computation is explicitly chained using `flatMap` or combined with other `Effect` values using the appropriate functions provided by the Effect library.

In the next section, we will explore how to address this problem using the `tap` API.

## tap

In the previous section, we discussed the problem of ignoring effects in a computation.
To address this issue, we can use the `tap` API, which allows us to execute side effects without affecting the computation flow.

The `tap` API has a similar signature to `flatMap`, but the result of the transformation function is **ignored**.
This means that the value returned by the previous computation (i.e. `[a, b]`) will still be available for the next computation (i.e. `divide`).

Let's take a look at an updated code snippet that incorporates the `tap` API to fix the problem:

```ts {3-5}
const flatMappedEffect = pipe(
  Effect.succeed([10, 2]),
  Effect.tap(([a, b]) =>
    Effect.sync(() => console.log(`Performing division: ${a} / ${b}`))
  ),
  // [a, b] is still available!
  Effect.flatMap(([a, b]) => divide(a, b))
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(flatMappedEffect))
/*
Performing division: 10 / 2
5
*/
```

By using `Effect.tap`, we include the effect of `Effect.sync` in the computation. This ensures that the logging action is performed, providing us with the desired output and maintaining correct program logic. The resulting output is still `5`, as expected.

Using `tap` allows us to execute side effects during the computation without altering the result. This can be useful for logging, performing additional actions, or observing the intermediate values without interfering with the main computation flow.

## all

The `Effect.all` function is a powerful utility provided by Effect that allows you to combine multiple effects into a single effect that produces a tuple of results.

The syntax for `all` is as follows:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const combinedEffect = Effect.all(...effects)
```

Here, `...effects` represents multiple effects that you want to combine. The `all` function will execute all these effects in sequence and return a new effect that produces a tuple containing the results of each individual effect. This can be useful when you need to perform multiple independent operations and collect their results in a structured way.

Keep in mind that the order of the results corresponds to the order of the original effects passed to `all`.

Let's see an example to better understand how `all` works:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const foo = Effect.succeed(42)
const bar = Effect.succeed("Hello")

// Effect<never, never, [number, string]>
const combinedEffect = Effect.all(foo, bar)

console.log(Effect.runSync(combinedEffect)) // Output: [42, "Hello"]
```

In this example, `foo` and `bar` are two separate effects. Using `Effect.all`, we combine them into a single effect `combinedEffect`. When we run `combinedEffect`, it produces a tuple `[42, "Hello"]` containing the results of both effects.

## Build your first pipeline

Now, let's combine all four functions (`pipe`, `map`, `flatMap` and `all`) to build a pipeline that performs a series of transformations:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1

function divide(a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<never, Error, number> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
  }
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

const foo = Effect.succeed(10)
const bar = Effect.succeed(2)

// Effect<never, Error, string>
const program = pipe(
  Effect.all(foo, bar),
  Effect.flatMap(([a, b]) => divide(a, b)),
  Effect.map((n1) => increment(n1)),
  Effect.map((n2) => `Result is: ${n2}`)
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(program)) // Output: "Result is: 6"
```

## The pipe method

Effect provides a `pipe` method that works similarly to the `pipe` method found in [`rxjs`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/pipe). This method allows you to chain multiple operations together, making your code more concise and readable.

Here's how the `pipe` **method** works:

```ts
const result = effect.pipe(func1, func2, ..., funcN)
```

This is equivalent to using the `pipe` **function** like this:

```ts
const result = pipe(effect, func1, func2, ..., funcN)
```

The `pipe` method is available on all effects and many other data types, eliminating the need to import the `pipe` function from the `@effect/data/Function` module and saving you some keystrokes.

Let's rewrite the previous example using the `pipe` method:

```ts {16}
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1

function divide(a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<never, Error, number> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
  }
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

const foo = Effect.succeed(10)
const bar = Effect.succeed(2)

// Effect<never, Error, string>
const program = Effect.all(foo, bar).pipe(
  Effect.flatMap(([a, b]) => divide(a, b)),
  Effect.map((n1) => increment(n1)),
  Effect.map((n2) => `Result is: ${n2}`)
)

console.log(Effect.runSync(program)) // Output: "Result is: 6"
```

## Cheatsheet

Let's summarize the transformation functions we have seen so far:

| **Function** | **Input**                                 | **Output**             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `map`        | `Effect<R, E, A>`, `A => B`               | `Effect<R, E, B>`      |
| `flatMap`    | `Effect<R, E, A>`, `A => Effect<R, E, B>` | `Effect<R, E, B>`      |
| `all`        | `Effect<R, E, A>`, `Effect<R, E, B>`      | `Effect<R, E, [A, B]>` |

These functions are powerful tools for transforming and chaining `Effect` computations. They allow you to apply functions to values inside `Effect` and build complex pipelines of computations.

Remember to choose the appropriate function based on the type of transformation you want to perform. If you have a function that directly returns a value without wrapping it in an `Effect`, you can use `map`. If you have a function that returns an `Effect` itself, you can use `flatMap` to chain computations.

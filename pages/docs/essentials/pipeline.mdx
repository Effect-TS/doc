# Building Pipelines

Effect pipelines allow for the composition and sequencing of operations on values, enabling the transformation and manipulation of data in a concise and modular manner.

In this tutorial you will learn:

- How `pipe` works and how to use it.
- How `map` works with an example.
- How `flatMap` works with an example.
- An example that combines all three functions to build a pipeline.

Let's get started!

## Understanding and Using `pipe`

The `pipe` function is a utility that allows us to compose functions in a readable and sequential manner. It takes the output of one function and passes it as the input to the next function in the pipeline. This enables us to build complex transformations by chaining multiple functions together.

The basic syntax of `pipe` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function";

const result = pipe(input, func1, func2, ..., funcN);
```

Here, `input` is the initial value, and `func1`, `func2`, ..., `funcN` are the functions to be applied in sequence. The result of each function becomes the input for the next function, and the final result is returned.

Let's see an example to understand it better.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1
const double = (x: number) => x * 2
const subtractTen = (x: number) => x - 10

const result = pipe(5, increment, double, subtractTen) // 2
```

In the above example, we start with the initial value of `5`. The `increment` function adds `1` to the initial value, resulting in `6`.
The `double` function doubles the value, giving us `12`. Finally, the `subtractTen` function subtracts `10` from `12`, resulting in the final output of `2`.

## Understanding `map`

The `map` function is used to transform the value inside an `Effect`.
It takes a function and applies it to the value contained within the `Effect`, creating a **new** `Effect` with the transformed value.

<Info>
  It's important to note that `Effect`s are immutable, meaning that when you use
  `map` on an `Effect`, it doesn't modify the original data type. Instead, it
  returns a new copy of the `Effect` with the transformed value.
</Info>

The syntax for `map` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const resultEffect = pipe(effect, Effect.map(func))
```

In the code above, `func` represents the transformation function to be applied, and `effect` is the input `Effect`.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how `map` works.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1

// mappedEffect: Effect.Effect<never, never, number>
const mappedEffect = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(5),
  Effect.map((x) => increment(x))
)

Effect.runSync(mappedEffect) // Output: 6
```

In the example above:

- We define a simple `increment` function that adds `1` to its input.
- We create an `Effect` using `Effect.succeed` with an initial value of `5`.
- We use `map` to apply the `increment` function to the value inside the `effect`.

The resulting `Effect` contains the transformed value of 6.

## Understanding `flatMap`

In the previous example, we saw how to transform an `Effect` using the `map` function when the transformation function returns a regular value. But what if we want to transform an `Effect` using a function that itself returns another `Effect`?

The `flatMap` function allows us to chain computations that produce `Effect` values. It takes a transformation function that produces a new `Effect` and then "flattens" the nested `Effect` structure.

The syntax for `flatMap` is as follows:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const resultEffect = pipe(effect, Effect.flatMap(func))
```

In the code above, `func` represents the transformation function that returns a new `Effect`, and `effect` is the input `Effect` that we want to transform.

Let's see an example to better understand how `flatMap` works.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

function divide(a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<never, Error, number> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
  }
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

// flatMappedEffect: Effect.Effect<never, Error, number>
const flatMappedEffect = pipe(
  Effect.succeed({ a: 10, b: 2 }),
  Effect.flatMap(({ a, b }) => divide(a, b))
)

Effect.runSync(flatMappedEffect) // Output: 5
```

In the example above:

- We define a function called `divide` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns an `Effect` that can potentially succeed with the result of the division or fail with an error if `b` is zero.
- We create an `Effect` using `Effect.succeed` with an object containing the values `a` and `b`.
- We use `flatMap` to apply the `divide` function to the values inside the `effect`.

The resulting `Effect` contains the transformed value of 5.

## Cheatsheet

Let's summarize the transformation functions we have seen so far:

| **Function** | **Input**                                 | **Output**        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `map`        | `Effect<R, E, A>`, `A => B`               | `Effect<R, E, B>` |
| `flatMap`    | `Effect<R, E, A>`, `A => Effect<R, E, B>` | `Effect<R, E, B>` |

These functions are powerful tools for transforming and chaining `Effect` computations. They allow you to apply functions to values inside `Effect` and build complex pipelines of computations.

Remember to choose the appropriate function based on the type of transformation you want to perform. If you have a function that directly returns a value without wrapping it in an `Effect`, you can use `map`. If you have a function that returns an `Effect` itself, you can use `flatMap` to chain computations.

## Build your first pipeline

Now, let's combine all three functions (`pipe`, `map` and `flatMap`) to build a pipeline that performs a series of transformations on a value:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const increment = (x: number) => x + 1

function divide(a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<never, Error, number> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
  }
  return Effect.succeed(a / b)
}

// result: Effect.Effect<never, Error, string>
const result = pipe(
  Effect.succeed({ a: 10, b: 2 }),
  Effect.flatMap(({ a, b }) => divide(a, b)),
  Effect.map(increment),
  Effect.map((x) => `Result is: ${x}`)
)

Effect.runSync(result) // Output: "Result is: 6"
```

## Dual APIs

When working with APIs like `map`, `flatMap`, and many others in the Effect ecosystem, you'll come across two different variants: the "data-last" variant and the "data-first" variant. Let's explore each variant and understand how they differ.

The "data-last" variant is the one we have been using so far. In this variant, the `Effect` is passed as the first argument to the `pipe` function, followed by the corresponding `Effect` function, such as `Effect.map`:

```ts
const mappedEffect = pipe(effect, Effect.map(increment))
```

This variant is useful when you need to chain multiple computations in a long pipeline. You can continue the pipeline by adding more computations after the initial transformation:

```ts
pipe(effect, Effect.map(increment), ...other computations...)
```

On the other hand, the "data-first" variant doesn't require the `pipe` function. Instead, you directly pass the `Effect` as the first argument to the corresponding `Effect` function:

```ts
const mappedEffect = Effect.map(effect, increment)
```

This variant is convenient when you only need to perform a single operation on the `Effect`.

When an API like `Effect.map` or `Effect.flatMap` supports both variants, we call them "dual" APIs.

Both variants have their advantages, and the choice depends on personal preference and the coding style of the project.

<Design>
  **Choosing Between the Variants**. It's important to note that both variants
  achieve the same result. They are simply two different ways of expressing the
  code. You can choose the variant that best fits your coding style and makes
  the code more readable for you and your team.

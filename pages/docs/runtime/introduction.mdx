# Introduction to Runtime

The `Runtime<R>` data type represents a Runtime System that can execute effects. To execute any effect, we need a `Runtime` that includes the necessary requirements for that effect.

A `Runtime<R>` consists of three main components:

- a value of type `Context<R>`
- a value of type `FiberRefs`
- a value of type `RuntimeFlags`

## The Default Runtime

When we use functions like `Effect.run*`, we are actually using the **default runtime** without explicitly mentioning it. These functions are designed as convenient shortcuts for executing our effects using the default runtime.

For instance, in the `Runtime` module, there is a corresponding `Runtime.run*(defaultRuntime)` function that is called internally by `Effect.run*`, e.g. `Effect.runSync` is simply an alias for `Runtime.runSync(defaultRuntime)`.

The default runtime includes:

- An empty `Context<never>`
- A set of `FiberRefs` that include the default services
- A default configuration for `RuntimeFlags` that enables `Interruption` and `CooperativeYielding`

In most cases, using the default runtime is sufficient. However, it can be useful to create a custom runtime to reuse a specific context or configuration. It is common to create a `Runtime<R>` by initializing a `Layer<RIn, Err, R>`. This allows for context reuse across execution boundaries, such as in a React App or when executing operations on a server in response to API requests.

## What is a Runtime System?

When we write an Effect program, we construct an `Effect` using constructors and combinators. Essentially, we are creating a blueprint of a program. An `Effect` is merely a data structure that describes the execution of a concurrent program. It represents a tree-like structure that combines various primitives to define what the `Effect` should do.

However, this data structure itself does not perform any actions; it is solely a description of a concurrent program.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand that when working with a functional effect system like Effect, our code for actions such as printing to the console, reading files, or querying databases is actually building a workflow or blueprint for an application. We are constructing a data structure.

So how does Effect actually run these workflows? This is where the Effect Runtime System comes into play. When we invoke a `Runtime.run*` function, the Runtime System takes over. First, it creates an empty root Fiber with:

- The initial context
- The initial fiberRefs
- The initial Effect

After the creation of the Fiber, it invokes the Fiber's runLoop, which follows the instructions described by the `Effect` and executes them step by step.

To simplify, we can envision the Runtime System as a black box that takes both the effect ([`Effect<R, E, A>`](../essentials/effect-type)) and its associated context (`Context<R>`). It runs the effect and returns the result as an [`Exit<E, A>`](../data-types/exit) value.

## Responsibilities of the Runtime System

Runtime Systems have a lot of responsibilities:

1. **Execute every step of the blueprint**. They have to execute every step of the blueprint in a while loop until it's done.

2. **Handle unexpected errors**. They have to handle unexpected errors, not just the expected ones but also the unexpected ones.

3. **Spawn concurrent fiber**. They are actually responsible for the concurrency that effect systems have. They have to spawn a fiber every time we call `fork` on an effect to spawn off a new fiber.

4. **Cooperatively yield to other fibers**. They have to cooperatively yield to other fibers so that fibers that are sort of hogging the spotlight, don't get to monopolize all the CPU resources.

5. **Ensure finalizers are run appropriately**. They have to ensure finalizers are run appropriately at the right point in all circumstances to make sure that resources are closed that clean-up logic is executed. This is the feature that powers [`Scope`](../resource-management) and all the other resource-safe constructs in Effect.

6. **Handle asynchronous callback**. They have to handle this messy job of dealing with asynchronous callbacks. So we don't have to deal with async code. When we are using Effect, everything can be interpreted as async or sync out of the box.

## Is it possible to extract the types from an Effect?

By using the utility types `Effect.Effect.Context`, `Effect.Effect.Error`, and `Effect.Effect.Success`, we can extract the corresponding types from the `program` Effect. In this example, we extract the context type (`R`), the error type (`E`), and the success type (`A`).

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/faq/effect-extract-types.ts

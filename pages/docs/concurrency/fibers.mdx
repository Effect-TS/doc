# Fibers

## What is a Fiber?

A "fiber" is a small unit of work or a lightweight thread of execution. It represents a specific computation or an effectful operation in a program. Fibers are used to manage concurrency and asynchronous tasks.

Think of a fiber as a worker that performs a specific job. It can be started, paused, resumed, and even interrupted. Fibers are useful when we want to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or handle long-running operations without blocking the main program.

By using fibers, developers can control and coordinate the execution of tasks, allowing for efficient multitasking and responsiveness in their applications.

To summarize:

- An `Effect` is a higher-level concept that describes an effectful computation. It is lazy and immutable, meaning it represents a computation that may produce a value or fail but does not immediately execute.
- A fiber, on the other hand, represents the running execution of an `Effect`. It can be interrupted or awaited to retrieve its result. Think of it as a way to control and interact with the ongoing computation.

## Creating Fibers

A fiber is created any time an effect is run. When running effects concurrently, a fiber is created for each concurrent effect.

## When do Fibers run?

New fibers begin execution after the current fiber completes or yields. This is necessary to prevent infinite loops in some cases, and is useful to know when using the `fork` APIs.

In the following example the `SubscriptionRef` `changes` stream only contains a single value `2` because the fiber (created by `fork`) to run the stream is started _after_ the value has been updated.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/concurrency/fibers/fiber-fork.ts

```

If we add `Effect.yieldNow()` to force the current fiber to yield then the stream will contain all values `0`, `1`, and `2` because the fiber running the stream has an opportunity to start before the value is changed.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/concurrency/fibers/fiber-fork-yieldNow.ts

```

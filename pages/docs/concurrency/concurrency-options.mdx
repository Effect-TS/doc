# Concurrency Options

Effect offers various options to manage how effects are executed and control the overall operation's result. These options help determine how many effects can run at the same time concurrently.

```ts
type Options = {
  readonly concurrency?: Concurrency
  /* ... other options ... */
}
```

In this section, we'll focus on the option that handles concurrency, which is the `concurrency` option with a type of `Concurrency`:

```ts
type Concurrency = number | "unbounded" | "inherit"
```

Let's understand the meaning of each configuration value.

<Info>
  The following examples use the `Effect.all` function, but the concept applies
  to many other Effect APIs that accept concurrency options, such as
  `Effect.forEach`.
</Info>

## Sequential Execution (Default)

By default, if you don't specify any concurrency option, effects will run sequentially, one after the other. This means each effect starts only after the previous one completes.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/concurrency/concurrency-options/all-default.ts

```

## Numbered Concurrency

You can control the number of concurrent operations with the `concurrency` option. For example, with `concurrency: 2`, up to 2 effects will run simultaneously.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/concurrency/concurrency-options/all-number.ts

```

## Unbounded Concurrency

If you set `concurrency: "unbounded"`, as many effects as needed will run concurrently, without any specific limit.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/concurrency/concurrency-options/all-unbounded.ts

```

## Inherit Concurrency

The `concurrency: "inherit"` option adapts based on context, controlled by `Effect.withConcurrency(number | "unbounded")`.

If there's no `Effect.withConcurrency` call, the default is `"unbounded"`. Otherwise, it inherits the configuration set by `Effect.withConcurrency`.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/concurrency/concurrency-options/all-inherit-default.ts

```

If you use `Effect.withConcurrency`, it will adopt that specific concurrency configuration.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/concurrency/concurrency-options/all-inherit-withConcurrency.ts

```

# Timing out

In the world of programming, we often deal with tasks that take some time to complete. Sometimes, we want to set a limit on how long we are willing to wait for a task to finish. This is where the `Effect.timeout` function comes into play. It allows us to put a time constraint on an operation, ensuring that it doesn't run indefinitely. In this guide, we'll explore how to use `Effect.timeout` effectively.

## timeout

Effect lets us timeout any effect using the `Effect.timeout` function. It returns a new effect with the following characteristics:

- If an error is returned, it signifies that the timeout expired before the completion of the effect's execution.
- If successful, it indicates that the effect finished within the specified timeout, and the result of the effect is included.

If an effect times out, then instead of continuing to execute in the background, it will be interrupted so no resources will be wasted.

Suppose we have the following effect:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/program.ts

```

When we apply `Effect.timeout` to `program`, it behaves in one of the following ways:

1. If the original effect (`program` in this case) completes before the timeout elapses, it returns the produced value by the original effect. Here's an example:

   ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/1.ts

   ```

2. If the timeout elapses before the original effect completes, and the effect is interruptible, it will be immediately interrupted, and the timeout operation produces a `NoSuchElementException` error. Here's an example:

   ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/2.ts

   ```

3. If the effect is uninterruptible, it will be blocked until the original effect safely finishes its work, and then the timeout operator produces a `NoSuchElementException` error. Here's an example:

   ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/3.ts

   ```

   If we want to return early after the timeout has passed and before an underlying effect has been interrupted, we can use `Effect.disconnect`. This technique allows the original effect to be interrupted in the background. Here's an example:

   ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/disconnect.ts

   ```

## Customizing Timeout Behavior

In addition to the basic `Effect.timeout` function, there are variations available that allow you to customize the behavior when a timeout occurs.

### timeoutTo

The `timeoutTo` function is similar to `Effect.timeout`, but it provides more control over the final result type. It allows you to specify what should be returned in case of a timeout. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/timeoutTo.ts

```

### timeoutFail

The `timeoutFail` function allows you to produce a specific error when a timeout happens. This can be helpful for signaling timeout errors in your code. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/timeoutFail.ts

```

### timeoutFailCause

The `timeoutFailCause` function allows you to produce a specific defect when a timeout occurs. This is useful when you need to handle timeouts as exceptional cases in your code. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/timing-out/timeoutFailCause.ts

```

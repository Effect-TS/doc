# Sandboxing

Errors are a common part of programming, and they can happen for various reasons, such as failures, defects, fiber interruptions, or even a combination of these factors. In this guide, we'll explore how to use the `Effect.sandbox` function to isolate and understand the causes of errors in your code.

## sandbox

The `Effect.sandbox` function is a valuable tool that allows you to encapsulate all the potential causes of an error in an effect. It exposes the full cause of an effect, whether it's due to a failure, defect, fiber interruption, or a combination of these factors.

Here's the signature of the `Effect.sandbox` function:

```typescript
sandbox: Effect<R, E, A> -> Effect<R, Cause<E>, A>
```

In simple terms, it takes an effect `Effect<R, E, A>` and transforms it into an effect `Effect<R, Cause<E>, A>` where the error channel now contains a detailed cause of the error.

By using the `Effect.sandbox` function, you gain access to the underlying causes of exceptional effects. These causes are represented as a type of `Cause<E>` and are available in the error channel of the `Effect` data type.

Once you have exposed the causes, you can utilize standard error-handling operators like `Effect.catchAll` and `Effect.catchTags` to handle errors more effectively. These operators allow you to respond to specific error conditions.

Let's walk through an example to illustrate how error sandboxing works:

```ts
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"

// $ExpectType Effect<never, string, string>
const effect = Effect.fail("Oh uh!").pipe(Effect.as("primary result"))

// $ExpectType Effect<never, Cause<string>, string>
const sandboxed = Effect.sandbox(effect)

// $ExpectType Effect<never, Empty | Annotated<string> | Sequential<string> | Parallel<string>, string>
const program = Effect.catchTags(sandboxed, {
  Die: (cause) =>
    Console.log(`Caught a defect: ${cause.defect}`).pipe(
      Effect.as("fallback result on defect")
    ),
  Interrupt: (cause) =>
    Console.log(`Caught a defect: ${cause.fiberId}`).pipe(
      Effect.as("fallback result on fiber interruption")
    ),
  Fail: (cause) =>
    Console.log(`Caught a defect: ${cause.error}`).pipe(
      Effect.as("fallback result on failure")
    )
})

// $ExpectType Effect<never, string, string>
const main = Effect.unsandbox(program)

Effect.runPromise(main).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Caught a defect: Oh uh!
fallback result on failure
*/
```

In this example, we expose the full cause of an effect using `Effect.sandbox`. Then, we handle specific error conditions using `Effect.catchTags`. Finally, if needed, we can undo the sandboxing operation with `Effect.unsandbox`.

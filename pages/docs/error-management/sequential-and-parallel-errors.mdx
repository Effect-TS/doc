# Parallel and Sequential Errors

In a typical Effect application, when an error occurs, it usually fails with the first error encountered by the Effect runtime. Let's look at an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/sequential-and-parallel-errors/first-error.ts

```

In this case, the `program` will fail with the first error, which is "Oh uh!":

## Parallel Errors

However, in some situations, you may encounter multiple errors, especially when performing parallel computations. When parallel computations are involved, the application may fail due to multiple errors. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/sequential-and-parallel-errors/parallel-errors.ts

```

In this example, the `program` runs both `fail` and `die` concurrently, and if both fail, it will result in multiple errors.

### parallelErrors

Effect provides a useful combinator called `Effect.parallelErrors` that exposes all parallel failure errors in the error channel. Here's how you can use it:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/sequential-and-parallel-errors/parallelErrors.ts

```

In this example, `Effect.parallelErrors` combines the errors from `fail1` and `fail2` into a single error.

  Note that this operator is **only for failures**, not defects or
  interruptions.

## Sequential Errors

When working with resource-safety operators like `Effect.ensuring`, you may encounter multiple sequential errors. This happens because regardless of whether the original effect has any errors or not, the finalizer is uninterruptible and will run. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/sequential-and-parallel-errors/sequential-errors.ts

```

In this case, the `program` will result in multiple sequential errors if both `fail` and the finalizer `die` encounter errors.

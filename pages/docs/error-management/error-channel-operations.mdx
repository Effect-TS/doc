# Error Channel Operations

In Effect you can perform various operations on the error channel of effects. These operations allow you to transform, inspect, and handle errors in different ways. Let's explore some of these operations.

## Map Operations

### mapError

The `Effect.mapError` function is used when you need to **transform or modify an error** produced by an effect, without affecting the success value. This can be helpful when you want to add extra information to the error or change its type.

```ts /string/1 /Error/1 file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/mapError.ts

```

We can observe that the type in the error channel of our program has changed from `string` to `Error`.

<Info>
  It's important to note that using the `Effect.mapError` function **does not
  change** the overall success or failure of the effect. If the mapped effect is
  successful, then the mapping function is ignored. In other words, the
  `Effect.mapError` operation only applies the transformation to the error
  channel of the effect, while leaving the success channel unchanged.
</Info>

### mapBoth

The `Effect.mapBoth` function allows you to **apply transformations to both channels**: the error channel and the success channel of an effect. It takes two map functions as arguments: one for the error channel and the other for the success channel.

```ts /string, number/ /Error, boolean/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/mapBoth.ts

```

After using `mapBoth`, we can observe that the type of our program has changed from `Effect<never, string, number>` to `Effect<never, Error, boolean>`.

<Info>
  It's important to note that using the `mapBoth` function **does not change**
  the overall success or failure of the effect. It only transforms the values in
  the error and success channels while preserving the effect's original success
  or failure status.

## Filtering the Success Channel

The Effect library provides several operators to **filter values on the success channel** based on a given predicate. These operators offer different strategies for handling cases where the predicate fails. Let's explore them:

| **Function**                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Effect.filterOrFail`                                | This operator filters the values on the success channel based on a predicate. If the predicate fails for any value, the original effect fails with an error.                                                                                      |
| `Effect.filterOrDie` and `Effect.filterOrDieMessage` | These operators also filter the values on the success channel based on a predicate. If the predicate fails for any value, the original effect terminates abruptly. The `filterOrDieMessage` variant allows you to provide a custom error message. |
| `Effect.filterOrElse`                                | This operator filters the values on the success channel based on a predicate. If the predicate fails for any value, an alternative effect is executed instead.                                                                                    |

Here's an example that demonstrates these filtering operators in action:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/filtering.ts

```

It's important to note that depending on the specific filtering operator used, the effect can either fail, terminate abruptly, or execute an alternative effect when the predicate fails. Choose the appropriate operator based on your desired error handling strategy and program logic.

In addition to the filtering capabilities discussed earlier, you have the option to further refine and narrow down the type of the success channel by providing a [user-defined type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates) to the `filterOr*` APIs. This not only enhances type safety but also improves code clarity. Let's explore this concept through an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/filtering-guards.ts

```

In the example above, a guard is used within the `filterOrFail` API to ensure that the `user` is of type `User` rather than `User | null`. This refined type information improves the reliability of your code and makes it more understandable.

If you prefer, you can utilize a pre-made guard like [`Predicate.isNotNull`](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/modules/Predicate.ts.html#isnotnull) for simplicity and consistency.

## Inspecting Errors

Similar to [tapping](../essentials/pipeline.mdx#tap) for success values, Effect provides several operators for **inspecting error values**. These operators allow us to peek into failures or underlying defects or causes:

- `tapError`
- `tapBoth`
- `tapErrorCause`
- `tapDefect`

Let's see an example of how to use these operators:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/tapError.ts

```

<Info>
  It's important to note that tapping into error values **does not change** the
  type of the program.

## Exposing Errors in The Success Channel

You can use the `Effect.either` function to convert an `Effect<R, E, A>` into another effect where both its failure (`E`) and success (`A`) channels have been lifted into an [`Either<E, A>`](../data-types/either.mdx) data type:

```ts
Effect<R, E, A> -> Effect<R, never, Either<E, A>>
```

The resulting effect is an unexceptional effect, which means it cannot fail, because the failure case has been exposed as part of the `Either` left case. Therefore, the error parameter of the returned Effect is `never`, as it is guaranteed that the effect does not model failure.

This function becomes especially useful when recovering from effects that may fail when using `Effect.gen`.

## Exposing the Cause in The Success Channel

You can use the `Effect.cause` function to **expose the cause** of an effect, which is a more detailed representation of failures, including error messages and defects.

## Merging the Error Channel into the Success Channel

Using the `Effect.merge` function, you can **merge the error channel into the success channel**, creating an effect that always succeeds with the merged value.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/merge.ts

```

## Flipping Error and Success Channels

Using the `Effect.flip` function, you can **flip the error and success channels** of an effect, effectively swapping their roles.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/error-management/error-channel-operations/flip.ts

```

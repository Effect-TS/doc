# Global Shared State Using Ref

One of the common use cases for `Ref` is to manage the state of applications, especially in concurrent environments.
We can use the `Ref` data type, which is a purely functional description of a mutable reference.

<Info>
  In this section, we will only cover the basic usage of the `Ref` data type. To
  learn more details about the `Ref`, especially its usage in concurrent
  programming, please refer to the [Ref](../concurrency/ref) page on the
  concurrency section.
</Info>

In the previous page, we have learned how to use recursive functions to manage the state of our application. However, this approach has the following drawbacks:

- We cannot share the state between multiple fibers.
- Sometime, writing the application logic is a bit tedious. It is somehow awkward to pass the state using function parameters.

Thanks to the `Ref` data type, we can easily use the `Ref` data type to manage the state of our application, whether we need concurrency or not.

## Example 1: Counter

Let's write a counter using the `Ref` data type:

```ts filename="Counter.ts"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Ref from "@effect/io/Ref"

export class Counter {
  constructor(private value: Ref.Ref<number>) {}
  inc = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n + 1)
  dec = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n - 1)
  get = Ref.get(this.value)
}

// Effect<never, never, Counter>
export const make = Ref.make(0).pipe(Effect.map((value) => new Counter(value)))
```

Here is the usage example of the `Counter`:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.flatMap(Counter.make, (counter) =>
  counter.inc.pipe(
    Effect.flatMap(() => counter.inc),
    Effect.flatMap(() => counter.dec),
    Effect.flatMap(() => counter.inc),
    Effect.flatMap(() => counter.get),
    Effect.flatMap((value) =>
      Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
    )
  )
)

Effect.runSync(program)
/*
... message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const counter = yield* _(Counter.make)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  yield* _(counter.dec)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  const value = yield* _(counter.get)
  yield* _(Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`))
})

Effect.runSync(program)
/*
... message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  All the operations on the `Ref` data type are effectful. So when we are
  reading from or writing to a `Ref`, we are performing an effectful operation.
</Info>

We can use this counter in a concurrent environment, e.g. in a RESTful API to count the number of requests. But for just an example, let's concurrently update the counter:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.flatMap(Counter.make, (counter) => {
  const logCounter = <R, E, A>(action: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>) =>
    counter.get.pipe(
      Effect.flatMap((value) => Effect.log(`get: ${value}`)),
      Effect.flatMap(() => action)
    )

  return counter.inc.pipe(
    Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
    Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.dec), { concurrent: true }),
    Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
    Effect.flatMap(() => counter.get),
    Effect.flatMap((value) =>
      Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
    )
  )
})

Effect.runSync(program)
/*
... fiber=#2 message="get: 0"
... fiber=#4 message="get: 1"
... fiber=#6 message="get: 1"
... fiber=#0 message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

// Effect<never, never, void>
const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const counter = yield* _(Counter.make)

  const logCounter = <R, E, A>(effect: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>) =>
    Effect.gen(function* (_) {
      const value = yield* _(counter.get)
      yield* _(Effect.log(`get: ${value}`))
      return yield* _(effect)
    })

  yield* _(
    counter.inc.pipe(
      Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.dec), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter(counter.inc), { concurrent: true })
    )
  )
  const value = yield* _(counter.get)
  yield* _(Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`))
})

Effect.runSync(program)
/*
... fiber=#2 message="get: 0"
... fiber=#4 message="get: 1"
... fiber=#6 message="get: 1"
... fiber=#0 message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

## Example 2: Read names from user input

In the [previous section](recursion#example-3-recursive-state-management-with-side-effects), we learned that we can have state management, even for effectful operations.

Here's how the code can be rewritten using the `Ref` data type:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"
import * as Ref from "@effect/io/Ref"

// Effect<never, never, Chunk.Chunk<string>>
const getNames = Effect.flatMap(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()), (ref) =>
  ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ").pipe(
    Effect.repeatWhileEffect((name) => {
      if (name === "q") {
        return Effect.succeed(false)
      } else {
        return ref.pipe(
          Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
          Effect.as(true)
        )
      }
    }),
    Effect.flatMap(() => Ref.get(ref))
  )
)

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(Alice, Bob)
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"
import * as Ref from "@effect/io/Ref"

// Effect<never, never, List.List<string>>
const getNames = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const ref = yield* _(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()))
  while (true) {
    const name = yield* _(
      ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ")
    )
    if (name === "q") {
      break
    }
    yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
  }
  return yield* _(Ref.get(ref))
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(Alice, Bob)
*/
```

</Tab>

Now that we have learned how to use the `Ref` data type, we can use it to manage the state concurrently. For example, assume while we are reading from the console, we have another fiber that is trying to update the state from a different source:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"
import * as Ref from "@effect/io/Ref"
import * as Fiber from "@effect/io/Fiber"

// Effect<never, never, Chunk.Chunk<string>>
const getNames = Effect.flatMap(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()), (ref) => {
  const fiber1 = ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ").pipe(
    Effect.repeatWhileEffect((name) => {
      if (name === "q") {
        return Effect.succeed(false)
      } else {
        return ref.pipe(
          Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
          Effect.as(true)
        )
      }
    }),
    Effect.fork
  )
  const fiber2 = Effect.fork(
    Effect.forEach(
      ["John", "Jane", "Joe", "Tom"],
      (name) =>
        ref.pipe(
          Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
          Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.sleep("1 seconds"))
        ),
      { concurrency: "unbounded", discard: true }
    )
  )
  return Effect.all([fiber1, fiber2]).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap(([f1, f2]) =>
      Fiber.join(f1).pipe(Effect.flatMap(() => Fiber.join(f2)))
    ),
    Effect.flatMap(() => Ref.get(ref))
  )
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(John, Jane, Alice, Joe, Bob, Tom)
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"
import * as Ref from "@effect/io/Ref"
import * as Fiber from "@effect/io/Fiber"

// Effect<never, never, Chunk.Chunk<string>>
const getNames = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const ref = yield* _(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()))
  const fiber1 = yield _(
    Effect.fork(
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        while (true) {
          const name = yield* _(
            ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ")
          )
          if (name === "q") {
            break
          }
          yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
        }
      })
    )
  )
  const fiber2 = yield* _(
    Effect.fork(
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        for (const name of ["John", "Jane", "Joe", "Tom"]) {
          yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
          yield* _(Effect.sleep("1 seconds"))
        }
      })
    )
  )
  yield* _(Fiber.join(fiber1))
  yield* _(Fiber.join(fiber2))
  return yield* _(Ref.get(ref))
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(John, Jane, Alice, Joe, Bob, Tom)

# Managing State Using Recursion

Managing state is a common pattern in programming, and it often involves using variables to keep track of the current state. Let's explore how we can manage state using recursion, which is a technique where a function calls itself to handle different states.

## Example 1: Calculating the Length of a List

One common scenario is calculating the length of a list. We can achieve this by using a variable, `count`, to store the intermediate result:

```ts
import * as List from "@effect/data/List"

const size = <A>(self: List.List<A>): number => {
  let count = 0
  for (const _ of self) {
    count++
  }
  return count
}

console.log(size(List.make(1, 2, 3))) // Output: 3
```

In this example, we iterate over each element in the list and increment the `count` variable to keep track of the number of elements. Finally, we return the value of `count` as the length of the list.

## Example 2: Recursive State Management

Another technique for managing state is using recursive calls and passing the updated state as a function argument. Let's modify the previous example to use recursion:

```ts
import * as List from "@effect/data/List"

const size = <A>(self: List.List<A>): number => {
  const loop = (result: number, state: List.List<A>): number => {
    if (List.isNil(state)) {
      return result
    } else {
      return loop(result + 1, state.tail)
    }
  }
  return loop(0, self)
}

console.log(size(List.make(1, 2, 3))) // Output: 3
```

In this updated version, we define an inner function `loop` that takes two arguments: `result`, which stores the current result, and `state`, which represents the remaining elements in the list. The function checks if the state is empty (`List.isNil(state)`), and if so, it returns the final result. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with an updated result (`result + 1`) and the next state (`state.tail`). This process continues until we reach the end of the list.

## Example 3: Recursive State Management with Side Effects

The same pattern can be applied when dealing with side effects. Let's consider an example where we want to read names from user input until the user enters the command `"q"` to exit.

First, let's introduce a `readLine` utility to read user input:

```ts filename="ReadLine.ts"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as NodeReadLine from "node:readline"

export const readLine = (
  message: string
): Effect.Effect<never, never, string> =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const rl = NodeReadLine.createInterface({
          input: process.stdin,
          output: process.stdout,
        })
        rl.question(message, (answer) => {
          rl.close()
          resolve(answer)
        })
      })
  )
```

Now, let's take a look at the main program:

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const loop = (
  state: Chunk.Chunk<string>
): Effect.Effect<never, never, Chunk.Chunk<string>> =>
  pipe(
    ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: "),
    Effect.flatMap((name) => {
      if (name === "q") {
        return Effect.succeed(state)
      } else {
        return loop(Chunk.append(state, name))
      }
    })
  )

const getNames = loop(Chunk.empty())

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(Alice, Bob)
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
import * as Chunk from "@effect/data/Chunk"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const loop = (
  state: Chunk.Chunk<string>
): Effect.Effect<never, never, Chunk.Chunk<string>> =>
  Effect.gen(function* (_) {
    const name = yield* _(
      ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ")
    )
    if (name === "q") {
      return state
    } else {
      return yield* _(loop(Chunk.append(state, name)))
    }
  })

const getNames = loop(Chunk.empty())

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then((result) => console.log(String(result)))
/*
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
Chunk(Alice, Bob)
*/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `loop` function is now responsible for managing the state, represented by the `state` variable. It reads input from the user and checks if the entered name is `"q"`. If so, it returns the final result using `Effect.succeed`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with an updated state by prepending the new name to the existing list.

On this page, we have learned how to have stateful computations in our programs using recursion. However, this approach is not suitable for concurrent programs, where multiple fibers want to change the state of the program concurrently. Let's move on to the next page, where we will discuss stateful computation over concurrent programs.

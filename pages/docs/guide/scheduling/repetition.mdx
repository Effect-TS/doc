# Repetition

Repetition is a common requirement when working with effects in software development. It allows us to perform an effect multiple times according to a specific repetition policy.

Repeat policies are used in the following functions:

- `repeat`: Repeats an effect until the schedule is done.
- `repeatOrElse`: Repeats an effect until the schedule is done, with a fallback for errors.

<Warning>
  Scheduled recurrences are in addition to the first execution, so that
  `repeat(effect, Schedule.once)` yields an effect that executes `effect`, and
  then if that succeeds, executes `effect` an additional time.
</Warning>

## repeat

The basic syntax of `repeat` is as follows:

```ts
Effect.repeat(action, policy)
```

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/repetition/repeat.ts

```

## repeatOrElse

There is another version of `repeat` that helps us to have a fallback strategy in case of erros,
if something goes wrong we can handle that by using the `Effect.repeatOrElse` function,
which helps up to add an `orElse` callback that will run in case of repetition failure.

The basic syntax of `repeatOrElse` is as follows:

```ts
Effect.repeatOrElse(action, policy, fallback)
```

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/repetition/repeatOrElse.ts

```

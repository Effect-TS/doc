# Built-in Schedules

To demonstrate the functionality of different schedules, we will be working with the following helper:

```ts filename="Delay.ts" file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/Delay.ts

```

The `log` helper logs the time delay between each execution. We will use this helper to showcase the behavior of various built-in schedules.

## forever

A schedule that always recurs and produces number of recurrence at each run.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/forever.ts

```

## once

A schedule that recurs one time.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/once.ts

```

## recurs

A schedule that only recurs the specified number of times.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/recurs.ts

```

## Recurring at specific intervals

In the context of scheduling, two commonly used schedules are `spaced` and `fixed`. While they both involve recurring at specific intervals, they have a fundamental difference in how they determine the timing of repetitions.

The `spaced` schedule creates a recurring pattern where each repetition is spaced apart by a specified duration. This means that there is a delay between the completion of one repetition and the start of the next. The duration between repetitions remains constant, providing a consistent spacing pattern.

On the other hand, the `fixed` schedule recurs on a fixed interval, regardless of the duration of the actions or the completion time of previous repetitions. It operates independently of the execution time, ensuring a regular recurrence at the specified interval.

### spaced

A schedule that recurs continuously, each repetition spaced the specified duration from the last run.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/spaced.ts

```

The first delay is approximately 100 milliseconds, as the initial execution is not affected by the schedule. Subsequent delays are approximately 200 milliseconds apart, demonstrating the effect of the `spaced` schedule.

### fixed

A schedule that recurs on a fixed interval. Returns the number of repetitions of the schedule so far.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/fixed.ts

```

The first delay is approximately 100 milliseconds, as the initial execution is not affected by the schedule. Subsequent delays are consistently around 200 milliseconds apart, demonstrating the effect of the `fixed` schedule.

## exponential

A schedule that recurs using exponential backoff

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/exponential.ts

```

## fibonacci

A schedule that always recurs, increasing delays by summing the preceding two delays (similar to the fibonacci sequence). Returns the current duration between recurrences.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/scheduling/built-in-schedules/fibonacci.ts

```

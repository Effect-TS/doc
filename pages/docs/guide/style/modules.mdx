# Modules

This style guide provides recommendations for writing modules in Effect.

## Importing Modules

The Effect ecosystem consists of multiple modules. To avoid conflicts with module names, it is recommended to use the **`import * as ...`** syntax when importing modules. This approach helps create namespaces for the modules.

For example:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Context from "@effect/data/Context"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"
```

However, there is one exception to this rule. Functions from the `Function` module, such as the `pipe` function, can be imported directly without the namespace.

For example:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
```

By importing `pipe` directly from the `Function` module, we can use it without specifying the namespace, making it more convenient to use.

## Types and Interfaces

To prevent naming conflicts, types and interfaces should also be "namespaced." Although this may seem verbose, it ensures that code written in this manner will never have naming conflicts.

For example:

```ts
// ✅
import type * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
const good: Effect.Effect<Random, Error, number> = ...

// ❌
import type { Effect } from "@effect/io/Effect"
const bad: Effect<Random, Error, number> = ...
```

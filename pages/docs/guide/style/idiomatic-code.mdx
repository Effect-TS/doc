# How to write idiomatic code

The Effect style guide provides recommendations for writing Effect modules.

## Modules

The Effect ecosystem consists of multiple modules. To avoid name conflicts, it is recommended to use the

**`import * as ...`**

syntax when importing modules.
This approach helps create namespaces for the modules.

Examples:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Context from "@effect/data/Context"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"
```

### Types and interfaces

Types and interfaces should also be "namespaced" to prevent clashes. While it may seem verbose, this explicit style ensures that code written in this manner will never have naming conflicts.

Examples:

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

// ✅
const good: Effect.Effect<Random, Error, number> = ...

// ❌
const bad: Effect<Random, Error, number> = ...
```

There is only one exception to this rule. Functions from the `Function` module can be used directly without the namespace.

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
```

# Do Simulation

The `Do` simulation in Effect allows you to write code in a more declarative style, similar to the "do notation" in other programming languages. It provides a way to define variables and perform operations on them using functions like `Effect.bind` and `Effect.let`.

## Motivation

Let's consider a scenario where we want to create a custom combinator that prints the elapsed time taken by an effect to execute:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const now = Effect.sync(() => new Date().getTime())

// Prints the elapsed time occurred to `self` to execute
const elapsed = <R, E, A>(
  self: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>
): Effect.Effect<R, E, A> =>
  pipe(
    now,
    Effect.flatMap((startMillis) =>
      pipe(
        self,
        Effect.flatMap((result) =>
          pipe(
            now,
            Effect.flatMap((endMillis) =>
              pipe(
                Effect.logInfo(`Elapsed: ${endMillis - startMillis}`),
                Effect.map(() => result)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed("some task"),
  Effect.delay(Duration.millis(200)),
  elapsed
)

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
/*
... message="Elapsed: 204"
some task
*/
```

This code is not only verbose but also has excessive levels of nesting, making it difficult to read and understand.

To simplify the code and address this issue, there are two solutions available:

1. Switching to generators
2. Using the `Do` simulation

## Using `Effect.gen`

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const now = Effect.sync(() => new Date().getTime())

const elapsed = <R, E, A>(
  self: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>
): Effect.Effect<R, E, A> =>
  Effect.gen(function* (_) {
    const startMillis = yield* _(now)
    const result = yield* _(self)
    const endMillis = yield* _(now)
    yield* _(Effect.logInfo(`Elapsed: ${endMillis - startMillis}`))
    return result
  })

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed("some task"),
  Effect.delay(Duration.millis(200)),
  elapsed
)

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
/*
... message="Elapsed: 204"
some task
*/
```

In this solution, we switch to using [generators](../../essentials/using-generators) to simplify the code. The `elapsed` function now uses a generator function (`Effect.gen`) to define the flow of execution. Within the generator, we use `yield*` to invoke effects and bind their results to variables. This eliminates the nesting and provides a more readable and sequential code structure.

## Using the `Do` simulation

Here's how the `Do` simulation works:

1. Start the `Do` simulation using the `pipe` function and `Effect.Do`:

   ```ts
   const program = pipe(
     Effect.Do()
     // ... rest of the code
   )
   ```

2. Inside the `Do` simulation scope, you can use the `Effect.bind` function to define variables and bind them to `Effect` values:

   ```ts
   Effect.bind("variableName", () => effectValue)
   ```

- `variableName` is the name of the variable you want to define. You can choose any name you like.
- `effectValue` is the `Effect` value that you want to bind to the variable. It can be the result of a function call or any other valid `Effect` value.

3. You can accumulate multiple `Effect.bind` statements to define multiple variables within the scope:

   ```ts
   Effect.bind("variable1", () => effectValue1),
   Effect.bind("variable2", ({ variable1 }) => effectValue2),
   // ... additional bind statements
   ```

4. Regular Effect functions like `Effect.flatMap`, `Effect.tap`, and `Effect.map` can still be used within the `Do` simulation. These functions will receive the accumulated variables as arguments within the scope:

   ```ts
   Effect.flatMap(({ variable1, variable2 }) => {
     // Perform operations using variable1 and variable2
     // Return an `Effect` value as the result
   })
   ```

Now let's rewrite the `elapsed` combinator using the `Do` simulation:

```ts
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const now = Effect.sync(() => new Date().getTime())

const elapsed = <R, E, A>(
  self: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>
): Effect.Effect<R, E, A> =>
  pipe(
    Effect.Do(),
    Effect.bind("startMillis", () => now),
    Effect.bind("result", () => self),
    Effect.bind("endMillis", () => now),
    Effect.tap(({ startMillis, endMillis }) =>
      Effect.logInfo(`Elapsed: ${endMillis - startMillis}`)
    ),
    Effect.map(({ result }) => result)
  )

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed("some task"),
  Effect.delay(Duration.millis(200)),
  elapsed
)

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log)
/*
... message="Elapsed: 204"
some task
*/
```

In this solution, we use the `Do` simulation to simplify the code. The `elapsed` function now starts with `Effect.Do()` to enter the simulation scope.
Inside the scope, we use `Effect.bind` to define variables and bind them to the corresponding effects.

<Design>
  Both solutions discussed, using generators and the `Do` simulation, achieve
  the same goal of simplifying the code and reducing nesting. They offer clearer
  and more readable code, making it easier to understand and work with. Choose
  the approach that best suits your preferences and requirements.

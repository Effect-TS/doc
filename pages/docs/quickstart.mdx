# Quickstart

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up a new Effect project from scratch using plain **TypeScript**.

<Steps>
### Create a project directory and navigate into it

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir hello-effect
cd hello-effect
```

### Initialize a TypeScript project using npm

```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript project.

### Initialize TypeScript

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

When running this command, it will generate a `tsconfig.json` file that contains configuration options for TypeScript. One of the most important options to consider is the `strict` flag.

Make sure to open the `tsconfig.json` file and verify that the value of the `strict` option is set to `true`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

### Install the necessary packages

```bash
npm install @effect/io @effect/data
```

These packages will provide the foundational functionality for your Effect project.

</Steps>

Let's write and run a simple program to ensure that everything is set up correctly:

In your terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

Now, open the `index.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

const program = Effect.sync(() => {
  console.log("Hello, World!")
})

Effect.runSync(program)
```

Now, you can run the `index.ts` file. If you have `ts-node` installed, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ts-node src/index.ts
```

You should see the message `"Hello, World!"` printed. This confirms that the program is working correctly.

# Logging

Effect provides a set of built-in utilities for logging. Let's explore the main ones.

## log

The `log` function is used to print a message at the current log level, which is `INFO` by default.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/log.ts

```

The log message contains the following information:

- `timestamp`: The timestamp when the log message was generated.
- `level`: The log level at which the message is logged.
- `fiber`: The identifier of the [fiber](../concurrency/fibers#what-is-a-fiber) executing the program.
- `message`: The content of the log message.
- `span`: (Optional) The duration of the span in milliseconds.

## Log Levels

### Debug

By default, `DEBUG` messages are **not** printed.

However, you can configure the default logger to enable them using `Logger.withMinimumLogLevel` and setting the minimum log level to `LoggerLevel.Debug`.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to enable `DEBUG` messages for a specific task (`task1`):

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts /Logger.withMinimumLogLevel(LoggerLevel.Debug)/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/debug-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts /Logger.withMinimumLogLevel(LoggerLevel.Debug)/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/debug-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

In the above example, we enable `DEBUG` messages specifically for `task1` by using the `Logger.withMinimumLogLevel` function.

By using `Logger.withMinimumLogLevel(effect, level){:ts}`, you have the flexibility to selectively enable different log levels for specific effects in your program. This allows you to control the level of detail in your logs and focus on the information that is most relevant to your debugging and troubleshooting needs.

### Info

By default, `INFO` messages are printed.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/info-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/info-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

In the above example, the `Effect.log` function is used to log an `INFO` message with the content `"start"` and `"done"`. These messages will be printed during the execution of the program.

### Warning

By default, `WARN` messages are printed.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/warning-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/warning-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error

By default, `ERROR` messages are printed.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/error-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/error-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fatal

By default, `FATAL` messages are printed.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/fatal-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/fatal-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Spans

Effect also provides support for spans, allowing you to measure the duration of specific operations or tasks within your program.

<Tabs>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.withLogSpan("myspan")/ /myspan=1011ms/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/spans-gen.ts

```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts /Effect.withLogSpan("myspan")/ /myspan=1011ms/ file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/spans-pipe.ts

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

In the above example, a span is created using the `Effect.logSpan` function. It measures the duration of the code block within the span and logs an `INFO` message with the content "The job is finished!" along with the span duration of 1011ms (`myspan=1011ms`).

## Disabling Default Logging

If you ever find yourself needing to turn off default logging, perhaps during test execution, there are various ways to achieve this within the Effect framework. In this section, we'll explore different methods to disable default logging.

**Using withMinimumLogLevel**

Effect provides a convenient function called `withMinimumLogLevel` that allows you to set the minimum log level, effectively disabling logging:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/disabling-logging-withMinimumLogLevel.ts

```

By setting the log level to `LogLevel.None`, you effectively disable logging, and only the final result will be displayed.

**Using a Layer**

Another approach to disable logging is by creating a layer that sets the minimum log level to `LogLevel.None`, effectively turning off all logging:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/disabling-logging-layer.ts

```

**Using a Custom Runtime**

You can also disable logging by creating a custom runtime that includes the configuration to turn off logging:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/observability/logging/disabling-logging-runtime.ts

```

In this approach, you create a custom runtime that incorporates the configuration to disable logging, and then you execute your program using this custom runtime.

# Running Effects

To run an `Effect`, we can use the variety of `run` functions available on the `Effect` module:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect";

// sync variant
export const programSync = Effect.runSync(Effect.succeed("Hello, World!"));
//           ^?

// promise variant
export const programPromise = Effect.runPromise(
  //           ^?
  Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
);

// promise Either variant
export const programPromiseEither = Effect.runPromiseEither(
  //           ^?
  Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
);

// callback variant
export const programCallback = Effect.runCallback(
  //           ^?
  Effect.succeed("Hello, World!"),
  (exit) => console.log("I'm done!")
);
```

<Callout type="info">
  `runSync` should only be used if your Effect doesn't perform any asynchronous
  tasks. If you're not sure, you can try using it, and it will crash at runtime
  with a noticeable error if you should be using one of the other run methods
  instead.
</Callout>

There's several more `run` functions available on the `Effect` module, but these are the some common ones you may use.

The ideal way to work with Effects is to have as much of your program as an Effect as possible. You should try to use the `run` functions as close to the "edge" of your program as possible. This will allow you to have the most flexibility in how you run your program and build up very sophisticated Effects.

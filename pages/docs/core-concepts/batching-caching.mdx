# Batching & Caching

Before we dig into the Effect's solution to batching and caching let's start with a description of the problem.

It is very common in apps to depend on a number of external data sources like:
- HTTP APIs
- Databases
- Filesystems

## Model Definition

Let's start with a fairly minimal model description:

```twoslash include model
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

interface User {
  readonly _tag: "User"
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly email: string
}

class GetUserError {
  readonly _tag = "GetUserError"
}

interface Todo {
  readonly _tag: "Todo"
  readonly id: number
  readonly message: string
  readonly ownerId: number
}

class GetTodosError {
  readonly _tag = "GetTodosError"
}

class SendEmailError {
  readonly _tag = "SendEmailError"
}
// - 1
```

```twoslash include classic
const getTodos = Effect.tryCatchPromise(
  () => fetch("https://api.example.demo/todos").then(_ => _.json() as Promise<Todo[]>),
  () => new GetTodosError()
)

const getUserById = (id: number) => Effect.tryCatchPromise(
  () => fetch(`https://api.example.demo/getUserById?id=${id}`).then(_ => _.json() as Promise<User>),
  () => new GetUserError()
)

const sendEmail = (address: string, text: string) => Effect.tryCatchPromise(
  () => fetch("https://api.example.demo/sendEmail", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ address, text }),
  }).then(_ => _.json() as Promise<void>),
  () => new SendEmailError()
)

const sendEmailToUser = (id: number, message: string) => Effect.flatMap(
  getUserById(id),
  (user) => sendEmail(user.email, message)
)

const notifyOwner = (todo: Todo) => Effect.flatMap(
  getUserById(todo.ownerId),
  (user) => sendEmailToUser(user.id, `hey ${user.name} you got a todo!`)
)
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
```

<Callout type="info">
In a real world scenario we may want to use a more precise types instead of directly using primitives for identifiers (see `@effect/data/Brand`). We may also want to include more information in the errors.
</Callout>

## Classic Approach

Given such a model we usually write up functions to call some API (or database, etc.) like the following:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// ---cut---
// @include: classic-1
```

<Callout type="info">
In a real world scenario we may not want to trust our APIs to actually return the expected data - for doing this properly you can use `@effect/schema/Schema` or similar alternatives such as `zod`.
</Callout>

When using the utilities we defined it is normal to end up with code that looks like the following:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: classic-1
// ---cut---
const program = Effect.flatMap(
  getTodos,
  Effect.forEachParDiscard(notifyOwner)
)
```

Here we used the `Effect.forEachParDiscard` to repeat an `Effect` for every `Todo` and the `Effect` repeated
first fetches the `User` who owns the todo and then sends an email.

We like writing code this way because it is **very expressive** and very easy to read, but is it **efficient**?

This code will execute tons of individual API calls. Many todos will likely have the same owner and
our APIs may also provide batched alternatives where you can request as many users as you would like to in one call.

So what can we do? Rewrite all our code to use a different form of API? Should we really do that?

Well **not anymore.**

## Declaring Requests

Let's rewrite our example to be as efficient as possible - we'll start by writing a model for the requests that our data sources support:

```twoslash include requests
import * as Request from "@effect/io/Request"

interface GetTodos extends Request.Request<GetTodosError, Todo[]> {
  readonly _tag: "GetTodos"
}
const GetTodos = Request.tagged<GetTodos>("GetTodos")

interface GetUserById extends Request.Request<GetUserError, User> {
  readonly _tag: "GetUserById"
  readonly id: number
}
const GetUserById = Request.tagged<GetUserById>("GetUserById")

interface SendEmail extends Request.Request<SendEmailError, void> {
  readonly _tag: "SendEmail"
  readonly address: string
  readonly text: string
}
const SendEmail = Request.tagged<SendEmail>("SendEmail")

type ApiRequest = GetTodos | GetUserById | SendEmail
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// ---cut---
// @include: requests-1
```

<Callout type="info">
We are using `@effect/data/Data` behind the scenes and given that requests will be compared using `@effect/data/Equal` for caching it is important to make sure they are compared by value. If you nest objects / arrays in your model, you should use Data.struct / Data.case / Data.tuple / etc.
</Callout>

## Declaring Request Resolvers

Now that we have our requests defined it is time to tell `Effect` how to resolve those requests. That's where we would use a `RequestResolver`.

Here we will define a single resolver per query. There is no right or wrong answer in how granular your resolvers should be
but usually you will split up your resolvers based on which API calls can be batched.

```twoslash include resolvers
import * as RequestResolver from "@effect/io/RequestResolver"

interface GetTodosResolver {
  readonly _: unique symbol
}

const GetTodosResolver = Context.Tag<GetTodosResolver, RequestResolver.RequestResolver<GetTodos>>(
  Symbol.for("@app/services/GetTodosResolver")
)

const GetTodosResolverLive = Layer.resolver(
  GetTodosResolver,
  // we assume we cannot batch GetTodos, we create a normal resolver
  RequestResolver.fromFunctionEffect((request: GetTodos) =>
    Effect.tryCatchPromise(
      () => fetch("https://api.example.demo/todos").then((_) => _.json()) as Promise<Todo[]>,
      () => new GetTodosError()
    )
  )
)

interface GetUserByIdResolver {
  readonly _: unique symbol
}

const GetUserByIdResolver = Context.Tag<GetUserByIdResolver, RequestResolver.RequestResolver<GetUserById>>(
  Symbol.for("@app/services/GetUserByIdResolver")
)

const GetUserByIdResolverLive = Layer.resolver(
  GetUserByIdResolver,
  // we assume we can batch GetUserById, we create a batched resolver
  RequestResolver.makeBatched((requests: GetUserById[]) =>
    pipe(
      Effect.tryCatchPromise(
        () => fetch("https://api.example.demo/getUserByIdBatch", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ users: requests.map(({ id }) => ({ id })) }),
        }).then((_) => _.json()) as Promise<User[]>,
        () => new GetUserError()
      ),
      Effect.flatMap((users) => Effect.forEachWithIndex(requests, (request, index) =>
        Request.completeEffect(request, Effect.succeed(users[index]))
      )),
      Effect.catchAll((error) => Effect.forEach(requests, (request) =>
        Request.completeEffect(request, Effect.fail(error))
      ))
    )
  )
)

interface SendEmailResolver {
  readonly _: unique symbol
}

const SendEmailResolver = Context.Tag<SendEmailResolver, RequestResolver.RequestResolver<SendEmail>>(
  Symbol.for("@app/services/SendEmailResolver")
)

// we assume we can batch SendEmail, we create a batched resolver
const SendEmailResolverLive = Layer.resolver(
  SendEmailResolver,
  RequestResolver.makeBatched((requests: SendEmail[]) =>
    pipe(
      Effect.tryCatchPromise(
        () => fetch("https://api.example.demo/sendEmailBatch", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ emails: requests.map(({ address, text }) => ({ address, text })) }),
        }).then((_) => _.json()),
        () => new SendEmailError()
      ),
      Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.forEach(requests, (request) =>
        Request.completeEffect(request, Effect.unit())
      )),
      Effect.catchAll((error) => Effect.forEach(requests, (request) =>
        Request.completeEffect(request, Effect.fail(error))
      ))
    )
  )
)

const ResolversLive = Layer.mergeAll(
  GetTodosResolverLive,
  GetUserByIdResolverLive,
  SendEmailResolverLive
)
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: requests-1
// ---cut---
// @include: resolvers-1
```

<Callout type="info">
Resolvers can also access context like any other `Effect` and there are many different ways of creating resolvers. You may want to check the reference documentation of the `@effect/io/RequestResolver` module next.
</Callout>


## Defining Queries

At this point we are ready to plug the pieces together! Let's do just that:

```twoslash include queries
const getTodos = Effect.request(
  //    ^?
  GetTodos({}),
  GetTodosResolver
)

const getUserById = (id: number) => Effect.request(
  GetUserById({ id }),
  GetUserByIdResolver
)

const sendEmail = (address: string, text: string) => Effect.request(
  SendEmail({ address, text }),
  SendEmailResolver
)

const sendEmailToUser = (id: number, message: string) => Effect.flatMap(
  getUserById(id),
  (user) => sendEmail(user.email, message)
)

const notifyOwner = (todo: Todo) => Effect.flatMap(
  getUserById(todo.ownerId),
  (user) => sendEmailToUser(user.id, `hey ${user.name} you got a todo!`)
)
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// ---cut---
// @include: queries-1
```

It looks like we are back at the beginning, same exact types and same exact composition.

But now the following program:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: queries-1
// ---cut---
const program = Effect.flatMap(
  getTodos,
  Effect.forEachParDiscard(notifyOwner)
)
```

Will only require **3** queries to be executed to our APIs instead of **1 + 2n** where **n** is the number of todos.

## Controlling Batching

Batching can be locally disabled using the `Effect.withRequestBatching("off")` utility in the following way:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: queries-1
// ---cut---
const program = Effect.withRequestBatching("off")(
  Effect.flatMap(
    getTodos,
    Effect.forEachParDiscard(notifyOwner)
  )
)
```

## Request Caching

Up to this point we optimized how requests are executed but there is still a catch - we are not doing any caching.

This leads to request duplication...

Fortunately we also have a primitive for caching in `Effect` and we use that to automatically cache requests.

Let's define a cache for the GetUserById to deduplicate the getUserCalls. We will assume a user doesn't change for 10 minutes.

```twoslash include caches
import { minutes } from "@effect/data/Duration"

interface GetUserByIdCache {
  readonly _: unique symbol
}

const GetUserByIdCache = Context.Tag<GetUserByIdCache, Request.Cache<GetUserById>>(
  Symbol.for("@app/services/GetUserByIdCache")
)

const GetUserByIdCacheLive = Layer.effect(
  GetUserByIdCache,
  Request.makeCache(10_000, minutes(10))
)
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: requests-1
// ---cut---
// @include: caches-1
```

We created a cache that can handle up to 10_000 requests of type `GetUserById` with each request valid for a maximum of 10 minutes.

We now have to wire it up in our `getUserById` function:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: caches-1
// ---cut---
const getUserById = (id: number) => Effect.request(
  GetUserById({ id }),
  GetUserByIdResolver,
  GetUserByIdCache
)
```

As we can observe from the type we are now required to provide the `GetUserByIdCache` service to any program that uses the `getUserById` query.

If we instead wanted to only cache requests if a cache is provided we can use the `Effect.serviceOption` helper and do the following:

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: caches-1
// ---cut---
const getUserById = (id: number) => Effect.request(
  GetUserById({ id }),
  GetUserByIdResolver,
  Effect.serviceOption(GetUserByIdCache)
)
```

And as you can see now we are no longer forced to provide a cache.


## Final Program

Assuming you've wired everything up correctly the following program:


```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: caches-1
// @include: queries-1
// ---cut---
import * as Schedule from "@effect/io/Schedule"

const main = pipe(
  getTodos,
  Effect.flatMap(Effect.forEachParDiscard(notifyOwner)),
  Effect.repeat(Schedule.fixed(minutes(1))),
  Effect.provideSomeLayer(Layer.mergeAll(GetUserByIdCacheLive, ResolversLive))
)
```

This should never execute the same `GetUserById` twice within a span of `10` minutes (assuming less than 10k users) while also making sure emails are sent in batches.

## How is this possible?

We recently introduced a new key primitive in the fiber that enables an execution to pause when it sees the program requires a request. In the process of pausing, the fiber will reify its stack into a continuation that can be externally performed.

```ts twoslash
// @include: model-1
// @include: imports-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: caches-1
// @include: queries-1
// ---cut---
const program = Effect.flatMap(
  getTodos,
  Effect.forEachParDiscard(notifyOwner)
)

const nextStep = Effect.flatMapStep(program, (step) => {
  switch (step._tag) {
    // the program is blocked on a number of requests
    case "Blocked": {
      const requests = step.i0
      const continuation = step.i1
      return Effect.flatMap(
        shipRequestsToBeExecutedAndWait(requests),
        () => continuation
      )
    }
    // the program completed
    case "Success":
    case "Failure": {
      return step
    }
  }
})

const shipRequestsToBeExecutedAndWait = <R, E, A>(
  requests: Effect.Blocked<R, E, A>["i0"]
): Effect.Effect<R, E, void> => {
  // go on mars and come back
  return Effect.unit()
}
```

By using the functions provided by the `@effect/io/RequestBlock` module, you can combine requests from multiple blocked
effects. By using the function `Effect.blocked(requests, continuation)`, you can express an effect that is blocked
on `requests` that should continue with `continuation`.

## Manipulating the Request Cache

Some caches may be short lived and only locally provided to effects for the purpose of deduplication
but some other ones can be long lived and last as long as your program survives. The request cache is implemented by using the `@effect/io/Cache` module that allows for caching generic effect returning functions.

In fact, the `Request.Cache<R>` type is nothing more than an alias to `Cache.ConsumerCache<R, never, Deferred<unknown, unknown>>` and
is used internally by `Effect` to deduplicate requests.

When caches are managed, like in this case, you may not want to expose to the consumer the full power of the cache. The creation
of new entries is usually a delicate process that only the cache owner should manage but operating on keys with operations to invalidate
existing entries, getting stats, etc. are all valid to share, which is why the `ConsumerCache<R, E, A>` type is exposed.

Let's explore how we would get statistics about the `UserCache` that we defined prior and how we would invalidate some
entries manually.

```ts twoslash
// @include: imports-1
// @include: model-1
// @include: requests-1
// @include: resolvers-1
// @include: caches-1
// @include: queries-1
// ---cut---
const operateOnCache = Effect.gen(function* ($) {
  const cache = yield* $(GetUserByIdCache)
  const stats = yield* $(cache.cacheStats())

  yield* $(Effect.log(`GetUserByIdCache hits: ${stats.hits}`))
  yield* $(Effect.log(`GetUserByIdCache misses: ${stats.misses}`))
  yield* $(Effect.log(`GetUserByIdCache size: ${stats.size}`))

  const keys = yield* $(cache.keys())

  for (const key of keys) {
    if (key.id % 2 === 0) {
      yield* $(cache.invalidate(key))
    }
  }
})
```

## Using Cache Directly

There are many cases where you have functions `(key: Key) => Effect<R, E, A>` that you would like to cache
and not necessarily every case is a good fit for the request model shown above. For example, non-batchable API
calls or intensive work.

Let's see how we would go about using cache:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Cache from "@effect/io/Cache"
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

declare const intensiveWork: (key: string) => Effect.Effect<never, never, string>

const program = Effect.gen(function* ($) {
  const cache = yield* $(Cache.make(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Duration.infinity, intensiveWork))

  const a0 = yield* $(cache.get("key0"))
  const b0 = yield* $(cache.get("key1"))
  const a1 = yield* $(cache.get("key0"))
  const b1 = yield* $(cache.get("key1"))

  if(a0 === a1 && b0 === b1) {
    yield* $(Effect.log("I'll always end up here...."))
  }
})
```

<Callout type="info">
In order for the cache to correctly compare two `Key` values if you are not using primitives (e.g. string, boolean, number), you should use types that implement
the `@effect/data/Equal` interface.
</Callout>

There are many more methods available in the `Cache` module. As a next step, check out the reference docs!

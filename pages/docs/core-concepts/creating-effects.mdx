# Effect

The `Effect` data type was designed to be a completely type-safe representation of any program.

Conceptually, we can begin to build a mental model of the `Effect` data type by thinking of it as a function that takes some `Context` as input and when executed can either fail with some `Error` or succeed with some `Value`.

```ts
declare const Effect: (context: Context) => Either<Error, Value>
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Note**: this mental model should be used for _conceptual_ purposes only -
  the `Effect` type is much more powerful than just a function.
</Callout>

The `Effect` type is parameterized by three generic type parameters:

`Effect<Context, Failure, Success>`

which have the following meaning:

- `Context`: Represents the contextual data which is required by the `Effect` in order to be executed

- `Failure`: Represents _expected_ failures that can occur when an `Effect` is executed

- `Success`: Represents the type of the value that an `Effect` can succeed with when executed

<Callout type="info">
  Throughout the Effect ecosystem, you will often see `Effect`'s type parameters
  abbreviated as `R`, `E`, and `A` respectively. This is just shorthand for
  `R`equirements, `E`rror, and the success value of type `A`.
</Callout>

You can think of each of these type parameters as separate "channels" within the `Effect` data type. Your program can interact with each of these "channels" during its execution.

## Creating Effects

Effect provides a variety of constructors which can be used to represent programs that succeed and return some value.

In the sections below, we walk through some of the more common use cases.

### From a Value

To create an `Effect` from a value, you can use the `succeed` constructor:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

export const fromValue = Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
//           ^?
```

By inspecting the type of `fromValue`, we can see it is `Effect<never, never, string>`. This type can be interpreted as:

> An effect that does not require any context, does not produce any expected failures, and succeeds with a value of type `string`

### From a Thunk

Generally, to defer a synchronous computation in JavaScript we can use a "thunk".

<Callout type="info">
  A "thunk" is a function that takes no arguments and may return some value.
</Callout>

Thunks are primarily useful for delaying the computation of a value until the result of said computation is actually needed.

Somtimes you may want to construct an `Effect` from a "thunk". This can be particularly useful when dealing with:

1. Synchronous computations that have side-effects (i.e. logging something to the console)
2. Expensive computations that are expensive to evaluate

To create an `Effect` from a "thunk", we can use the `sync` constructor:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

export const logHelloWorld = Effect.sync(() => {
  //           ^?
  console.log("Hello, World!")
  return 42
})
```

In the above example, we use `Effect.sync` to defer our side-effecting call to the `console` object until our program is actually executed.

We can also observe that the value that will be returned when this program is executed is of type `number` since we return the value `42` from our "thunk".

### From a Promise

When dealing with _asynchronous_ side effects that return a `Promise` you can use the `promise` function.

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

export const fetchFirstTodo = Effect.promise(() =>
  //           ^?
  fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
)
```

Once again inspecting the return type we can see that it is `Effect<never, never, Response>`.

### From a Callback

Sometimes you have to deal with APIs that do not support `async/await` or `Promise`, but are instead implemented in the "old-school" callback style. To support callback-based APIs, Effect provides the `async` constructor.

<Callout type="info">
  Note: Although callback-based APIs may be _considered_ "old-school", they are
  inherently more powerful than `Promise`-based APIs. This is because they are
  both faster than `Promise`-based APIs as well as more precise in handling
  failures.
</Callout>

As an example, we can demonstrate wrapping `readFile` from the NodeJS `fs` module with Effect:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as NodeFS from "node:fs"

export const readTodos = Effect.async<never, NodeJS.ErrnoException, Buffer>(
  //           ^?
  (resume) => {
    NodeFS.readFile("todos.txt", (error, data) => {
      if (error) {
        resume(Effect.fail(error))
      } else {
        resume(Effect.succeed(data))
      }
    })
  }
)
```

Something to note in the above example is that we were actually forced to manually annotate the types when calling `Effect.async`. Unfortunately, TypeScript is not capable of inferring the type parameters for a callback based on what is returned inside the body of the callback. This limitation of TypeScript is the one minor drawback of using callback-based APIs. Annotating the types of `Effect.async` will ensure that the values provided to `resume` match the expected types.

Another thing to note is that we probably don't want to have to call the `Effect.async` constructor everywhere that we use callback-based APIs. Therefore, it is a very common pattern to define helpers which wrap external APIs into an Effect-based API.

For example, we can refactor the previous code into:

```ts twoslash
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as NodeFS from "node:fs"

export const readFile = (
  path: string
): Effect.Effect<never, NodeJS.ErrnoException, Buffer> =>
  Effect.async((resume) => {
    NodeFS.readFile(path, (error, data) => {
      if (error) {
        resume(Effect.fail(error))
      } else {
        resume(Effect.succeed(data))
      }
    })
  })

export const readTodos = readFile("todos.txt")
//           ^?
```

What makes all of the above particularly powerful is that we can seamlessly mix synchronous and asynchronous code. When working within the Effect world, everything becomes an Effect.

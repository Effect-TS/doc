# Option

The `Option` data type is used to represent optional values. An `Option` can be either `Some`, which contains a value, or `None`, which indicates the absence of a value.

The `Option` type is versatile and can be applied in various scenarios, including:

- Using it for initial values
- Returning values from functions that are not defined for all possible inputs (referred to as "partial functions")
- Managing optional fields in data structures
- Handling optional function arguments

## Creating Options

The `some` constructor takes a value of type `A` and returns an `Option<A>` that holds that value:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/some.ts

```

On the other hand, the `none` constructor returns an `Option<never>`, representing the absence of a value:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/none.ts

```

## Modeling Optional Properties

Let's look at an example of a `User` model where the `"email"` property is optional and can have a value of type `string`.
To represent this, we can use the `Option<string>` type:

```ts {6} file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/optional-property.ts#L1-L7

```

<Warning>
  Optionality only applies to the value of the property. The key `"email"` will
  always be present in the object, regardless of whether it has a value or not.
</Warning>

Now, let's see how we can create instances of `User` with and without an email:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/optional-property.ts#L9-

```

## Guards

You can determine whether an `Option` is a `Some` or a `None` by using the `isSome` and `isNone` guards:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/guards.ts

```

## Matching

The `Option.match` function allows you to handle different cases of an `Option` value by providing separate actions for each case:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/match.ts

```

<Idea>
  Using `match` instead of `isSome` or `isNone` can be more expressive and
  provide a clear way to handle both cases of an `Option`.
</Idea>

## Working with `Option`

The `Option.map` function allows you to transform the value inside an `Option` without having to unwrap and wrap the underlying value. Let's see an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/map-some.ts

```

The convenient aspect of using `Option` is how it handles the absence of a value, represented by `None`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/map-none.ts

```

Despite having `None` as the input, we can still operate on the `Option` without encountering errors. The mapping function `(n) => n + 1` is not executed when the `Option` is `None`, and the result remains `none` representing the absence of a value.

The `flatMap` function works similarly to `map`, but with an additional feature. It allows us to sequence computations that depend on the absence or presence of a value in an `Option`.

Let's explore an example that involves a **nested** optional property. We have a `User` model with an optional `address` field of type `Option<Address>`:

```ts {7} file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/nested.ts#L1-L8

```

The `address` field itself contains a nested optional property called `street` of type `Option<string>`:

```ts {3} file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/nested.ts#L10-L13
interface Address {
  readonly city: string
  readonly street: Option.Option<string>
}
```

We can use `Option.flatMap` to extract the `street` property from the `address` field.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/nested.ts#L15-

```

Here's how it works: if the `address` is `Some`, meaning it has a value, the mapping function `(addr) => addr.street` is applied to retrieve the `street` value. On the other hand, if the `address` is `None`, indicating the absence of a value, the mapping function is not executed, and the result is also `None`.

Here's a summary of the two functions:

## Getting the Value from an `Option`

To retrieve the value stored within an `Option`, you can use various functions provided by the `Option` module. Let's explore these functions:

- `getOrThrow`: It retrieves the wrapped value from an `Option`, or throws an error if the `Option` is a `None`. Here's an example:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/getOrThrow.ts

  ```

- `getOrNull` and `getOrUndefined`: These functions are useful when you want to work with code that doesn't use `Option`. They allow you to retrieve the value of an `Option` as `null` or `undefined`, respectively. Examples:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/getOrNull.ts

  ```

- `getOrElse`: This function lets you provide a default value that will be returned if the `Option` is a `None`. Here's an example:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/getOrElse.ts

  ```

## Fallback

In certain situations, when a computation returns `None`, you may want to try an alternative computation that returns an `Option`. This is where the `Option.orElse` function comes in handy. It allows you to chain multiple computations together and continue with the next one if the previous one resulted in `None`. This can be useful for implementing retry logic, where you want to attempt a computation multiple times until you either succeed or exhaust all possible attempts.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/orElse.ts

```

Additionally, the `Option.firstSomeOf` function can be used to retrieve the first value that is `Some` within an iterable of `Option` values:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/firstSomeOf.ts

```

## Interop with Nullable Types

When working with the `Option` data type, you may come across code that uses `undefined` or `null` to represent optional values. The `Option` data type provides several APIs to facilitate the interaction between `Option` and nullable types.

You can create an `Option` from a nullable value using the `fromNullable` API.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/fromNullable.ts

```

Conversely, if you have a value of type `Option` and want to convert it to a nullable value, you have two options:

- Convert `None` to `null` using the `getOrNull` API.
- Convert `None` to `undefined` using the `getOrUndefined` API.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/getOrNull.ts

```

## Interop with Effect

The `Option` type is a subtype of the `Effect` type, which means that it can be seamlessly used with functions from the `Effect` module. These functions are primarily designed to work with `Effect` values, but they can also handle `Option` values and process them correctly.

In the context of `Effect`, the two members of the `Option` type are treated as follows:

- `None` is equivalent to `Effect<never, NoSuchElementException, never>`
- `Some<A>` is equivalent to `Effect<never, never, A>`

To illustrate this interoperability, let's consider the following example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/interop-effect.ts

```

## Combining Two or More `Option`s

The `Option.zipWith` function allows you to combine two `Option` values using a provided function. It creates a new `Option` that holds the combined value of both original `Option` values.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/zipWith.ts

```

The `zipWith` function takes three arguments:

- The first `Option` you want to combine
- The second `Option` you want to combine
- A function that takes two arguments, which are the values held by the two `Options`, and returns the combined value

It's important to note that if either of the two `Option` values is `None`, the resulting `Option` will also be `None`:

```ts {4} file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/option/zipWith-none.ts

```

# Either

The `Either` data type represents two exclusive possible values: an `Either<E, A>` can be either a `Left` value or a `Right` value, where `E` represents the type of the `Left` value and `A` represents the type of the `Right` value.

## Creating Eithers

You can create an `Either` using the `Either.left` and `Either.right` constructors.

- The `Either.right` function takes a value of type `A` and constructs a `Either<never, A>`:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/right.ts

  ```

- The `Either.left` function takes a value of type `E` and constructs a `Either<E, never>`:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/left.ts

  ```

## Guards

You can determine whether an `Either` is a `Left` or a `Right` by using the `Either.isLeft` and `Either.isRight` guards:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/guards.ts

```

## Pattern Matching

The `Either.match` function allows you to handle different cases of an `Either` by providing separate callbacks for each case:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/match.ts

```

<Idea>
  Using `match` instead of `isLeft` or `isRight` can be more expressive and
  provide a clear way to handle both cases of an `Either`.
</Idea>

## Working with Either

Once you have an `Either`, there are several operations you can perform on it.

### Mapping over the Right Value

You can use the `Either.map` function to transform the `Right` value of an `Either`.
The `map` function takes a transformation function that maps the `Right` value.

If the `Either` value is a `Left` value, the transformation function is **ignored**, and the `Left` value is returned unchanged.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/mapRight.ts

```

### Mapping over the Left Value

You can use the `Either.mapLeft` function to transform the `Left` value of an Either. The `mapLeft` function takes a transformation function that maps the `Left`.

If the `Either` value is a `Right` value, the transformation function is **ignored**, and the `Right` value is returned unchanged.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/mapLeft.ts

```

### Mapping over Both Values

You can use the `Either.mapBoth` function to transform both the `Left` and `Right` values of an `Either`. The `mapBoth` function takes two transformation functions: one for the `Left` value and one for the `Right` value.

**Example**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/mapBoth.ts

```

## Interop with Effect

The `Either` type is a subtype of the `Effect` type, which means that it can be seamlessly used with functions from the `Effect` module. These functions are primarily designed to work with `Effect` values, but they can also handle `Option` values and process them correctly.

In the context of `Effect`, the two members of the `Either` type are treated as follows:

- `Left<E>` is equivalent to `Effect<never, E, never>`
- `Right<A>` is equivalent to `Effect<never, never, A>`

To illustrate this interoperability, let's consider the following example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/data-types/either/interop-effect.ts

```

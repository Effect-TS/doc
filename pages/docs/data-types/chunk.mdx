# Chunk

A `Chunk<A>` represents a chunk of values of type `A`.
Chunks are usually backed by arrays, but expose a purely functional, safe interface to the underlying elements, and they become lazy on operations that would be costly with arrays, such as repeated concatenation. Like lists and arrays, `Chunk` is an ordered collection.

## Why Chunk?

Let's explore the reasons behind using `Chunk`:

- **Immutability**: In JavaScript, there is no built-in immutable data type that can efficiently represent an array. While the `Array` type exists, it provides a mutable interface, which means it can be modified after creation. `Chunk`, on the other hand, is an immutable array-like data structure that ensures the data remains unchanged. Immutability is beneficial in various scenarios, especially when dealing with concurrent programming.

- **High Performance**: `Chunk` not only offers immutability but also delivers high performance. It provides specialized operations for common array manipulations, such as appending a single element or concatenating two `Chunk`s together. These specialized operations are significantly faster than performing the same operations on regular JavaScript arrays.

## Operations

### Creating

To create an empty `Chunk`, you can use the following code:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/empty.ts

```

If you want to create a `Chunk` with specific values, you can use the `Chunk.make(...values){:ts}` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/make.ts

```

Alternatively, you can create a `Chunk` by providing a collection of values. There are multiple ways to achieve this:

- Creating a `Chunk` from a generic `Iterable`:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/fromIterable.ts

  ```

- Creating a `Chunk` from an `Array`:

  ```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/unsafeFromArray.ts

  ```

`Chunk.fromIterable` makes a chunk by cloning the iterable, which can be an expensive process for large iterables or when making many Chunks. `unsafeFromArray` doesn't do any cloning which can have performance benefits, but this breaks the assumption that Chunk is immutable.

<Warning>
  It is important to note that using `unsafeFromArray` can potentially lead to
  unsafe or unexpected behavior if the input array is mutated after conversion.
  If you want to ensure safety, it is recommended to use `fromIterable`.

### Concatenating

You can concatenate two Chunks using the `concat` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/appendAll.ts

```

### Dropping

To drop elements from the beginning of a `Chunk`, you can use the `drop` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/drop.ts

```

### Comparing

You can compare two `Chunk`s for equality using the `Equal.equals` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/equals.ts

```

### Converting

To convert a `Chunk` to a `ReadonlyArray`, you can use the `toReadonlyArray` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/chunk/toReadonlyArray.ts

```

# Duration

The `Duration` data type data type is used to represent specific non-negative spans of time. It is commonly used to represent time intervals or durations in various operations, such as timeouts, delays, or scheduling. The `Duration` type provides a convenient way to work with time units and perform calculations on durations.

## Creating Durations

The `Duration` module provides several constructors to create durations of different units. Here are some examples:

```ts
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const duration1 = Duration.millis(500) // Create a duration of 500 milliseconds
const duration2 = Duration.seconds(2) // Create a duration of 2 seconds
const duration3 = Duration.minutes(5) // Create a duration of 5 minutes
```

You can create durations using units such as milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks.

## Getting the Duration Value

You can retrieve the value of a duration in milliseconds using the `millis` property:

```ts
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const duration = Duration.seconds(30)

console.log(duration.millis) // Output: 30000
```

## Comparing Durations

You can compare two durations using the `Order` instance provided by the `@effect/data/Duration` module. The `Order` instance defines the `compare` method, which returns a negative number if the first duration is less than the second, a positive number if it is greater, and zero if they are equal.

```ts
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const duration1 = Duration.seconds(30)
const duration2 = Duration.minutes(1)

console.log(Duration.Order.compare(duration1, duration2)) // Output: -1 (duration1 is less than duration2)
```

## Performing Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations on durations, such as addition and multiplication. Here are some examples:

```ts
import * as Duration from "@effect/data/Duration"

const duration1 = Duration.seconds(30)
const duration2 = Duration.minutes(1)

const sum = Duration.sum(duration1, duration2)
console.log(sum) // Output: Duration(90000)

const multiplied = Duration.times(2)(duration1)
console.log(multiplied) // Output: Duration(60000)
```

# Duration

The `Duration` data type data type is used to represent specific non-negative spans of time. It is commonly used to represent time intervals or durations in various operations, such as timeouts, delays, or scheduling. The `Duration` type provides a convenient way to work with time units and perform calculations on durations.

## Creating Durations

The `Duration` module provides several constructors to create durations of different units. Here are some examples:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/creating.ts

```

You can create durations using units such as nanoseconds, microsecond, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks.

If you want to create an infinite duration, you can use `Duration.infinity`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/infinity.ts

```

Another option for creating durations is using the `Duration.decode` helper:

- `number`s are treated as milliseconds
- `bigint`s are treated as nanoseconds
- strings must be formatted as `"${number} ${unit}"`

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/decode.ts

```

## Getting the Duration Value

You can retrieve the value of a duration in milliseconds using the `toMillis` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/toMillis.ts

```

You can retrieve the value of a duration in nanoseconds using the `toNanos` function:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/toNanos.ts

```

Note that `toNanos` returns an `Option<bigint>` since the duration might be infinite. If you want a `bigint` as a return type, you can use `unsafeToNanos`. However, note that it will throw an error for infinite durations:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/unsafeToNanos.ts

```

## Comparing Durations

You can compare two durations using the following functions:

| **Function**           | **Description**                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lessThan`             | returns `true` if the first duration is less than the second                |
| `lessThanOrEqualTo`    | returns `true` if the first duration is less than or equal to the second    |
| `greaterThan`          | returns `true` if the first duration is greater than the second             |
| `greaterThanOrEqualTo` | returns `true` if the first duration is greater than or equal to the second |

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/comparing.ts

```

## Performing Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations on durations, such as addition and multiplication. Here are some examples:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/reference/data-types/duration/arithmetic-operations.ts

```

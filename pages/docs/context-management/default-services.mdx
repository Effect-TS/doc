# Default Services

Effect comes equipped with five pre-built services:

```ts
type DefaultServices = Clock | Console | Random | ConfigProvider | Tracer
```

When we employ these services, there's no need to explicitly provide their implementations. Effect automatically supplies live versions of these services to our effects, sparing us from manual setup.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/guide/context-management/default-services/example.ts

```

As you can observe, even if our program utilizes both `Clock` and `Console`, the `R` parameter, representing the contextual data required for the effect to execute, remains set to `never`.

```ts /never/1
Effect<never, never, void>
```

Effect takes care of handling these services seamlessly for us.

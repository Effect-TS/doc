# Manage dependencies

Until now, we've only worked with Effects that have no context. In `Effect<R, E, A>`, R was always the `never` type.

In this section, we'll learn how to work with Effects that have a context. We'll see how to create Effects that require a context, and how to provide that context to the Effect.

## Creating a simple service interface

Let's create a service that implements a random number generator.

```twoslash include service-interface
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"
import * as Context from "@effect/data/Context";
import { pipe } from "@effect/data/Function";


export interface CustomRandom {
  readonly next: () => Effect.Effect<never, never, number>;
}

export const CustomRandom = Context.Tag<CustomRandom>();
// - 1

const serviceExample = pipe(
//           ^?
  CustomRandom,
  Effect.flatMap(randomService => randomService.next()),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
);
// - 2

```

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-1
```

The above code creates an interface for a service called `CustomRandom`. It has a single method called `next` that returns a random number. The Tag allows Effect to find this service at runtime.

<Callout type="info">
  Naming the interface the same as the value makes it easier to import in
  TypeScript, so it's recommended that you name the interface the same as the
  Tag.
</Callout>

## Using the service interface

Now that we have a service interface, let's use it in an Effect.

{/* TODO This is copy-pasted from the section above, not sure what the recommended way to re-use this is in twoslash */}

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-1
// ---cut---
export const serviceExample = pipe(
  //           ^?
  CustomRandom,
  Effect.flatMap((randomService) => randomService.next()),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
)
```

Here, we can map over the `CustomRandom` Tag as if it is an Effect. Notice how we can use the `next` method after mapping over the Tag. Then, we are logging the random number.

Also, most importantly, the type of `serviceExample` now has something in the R type parameter. Instead of never, it now shows `CustomRandom`.

If we try to execute this Effect without the service being provided, we see an error like the following:

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-1
// ---cut---
// @errors: 2345
export const serviceExample = pipe(
  CustomRandom,
  Effect.flatMap((randomService) => randomService.next()),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
)

Effect.runPromise(serviceExample)
```

This way, we can guarantee that the Effect has the required context before it is executed.

So far, we have an interface definition and we have used the interface. In the next section, we will look at how to provide an actual implementation of `CustomRandom` to `serviceExample`.

## Providing a service implementation

To provide an actual implementation of `CustomRandom`, we need to use the `provideService` function.

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-2
// ---cut---
const provideServiceExample = pipe(
  //    ^?
  serviceExample,
  Effect.provideService(CustomRandom, {
    next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()),
  })
)
```

Here, we called `serviceExample` from above and provide it with an implementation of `CustomRandom`. We can see that the `R` type parameter of `provideServiceExample` is `never`. This means that the Effect has no context left that is required to be provided.

## Combining multiple services together

If we have multiple services that can be combined together into a single context/environment, we can build up a Context like the following:

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-2
// ---cut---
export interface AnswerToLife {
  readonly getAnswerToLife: () => number
}

export const AnswerToLife = Context.Tag<AnswerToLife>()

const context = pipe(
  //    ^?
  Context.empty(),
  Context.add(CustomRandom, { next: () => Effect.succeed(Math.random()) }),
  Context.add(AnswerToLife, { getAnswerToLife: () => 42 })
)

export const provideContextExample = pipe(
  serviceExample,
  Effect.provideContext(context)
)
```

Here, we've created another interface so our context can combine multiple service implementations together.

Instead of using `provideService`, we can instead using `provideContext` to provide multiple contexts together as one.

## Optional services

Sometimes, we may want to access a service implementation only if it is available. We can use the `serviceOption` function to handle this.

```ts twoslash
// @include: service-interface-1
// ---cut---
import * as Option from "@effect/data/Option"

const optionalServiceExample = pipe(
  //    ^?
  Effect.serviceOption(CustomRandom),
  Effect.flatMap((service) =>
    Option.match(
      service,
      // When it doesn't exist
      () => Effect.succeed(-1),
      // When it exists
      (randomService) => randomService.next()
    )
  ),
  Effect.flatMap((randomNumber) => Effect.logInfo(`${randomNumber}`))
)
```

You can see how the `R` type parameter of `optionalServiceExample` is `never`, even though we're working with a service. This lets you access something from a context only if it is actually provided before this Effect is executed.

## Looking forward

In this section, we have looked at a simple example of defining a service interface, using it in an Effect, and providing an implementation of the service interface to the Effect. We also looked at combining multiple services together in a context.

In the next section, we will look at `layers`. Layers are very powerful constructors for services and allow us to create complex contexts that can be provided to Effects.

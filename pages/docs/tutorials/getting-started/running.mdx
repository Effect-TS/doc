# Running Effects

To execute an `Effect`, we can utilize a variety of `run*` functions provided by the `Effect` module.

## runSync

The `runSync` function is used to execute an Effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runSync(
  Effect.sync(() => {
    console.log("Hello, World!")
    return 1
  })
) // 1
```

If you check the console, you will see the message `"Hello, World!"` printed.

<Warning>
  `runSync` will throw an error if your Effect fails or performs any
  asynchronous tasks
</Warning>

```ts
Effect.runSync(Effect.fail("error")) // throws

Effect.runSync(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))) // throws
```

## runSyncEither

The `runSyncEither` function is used to execute an Effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result as an `Either`
(a data type used to represent the possibility of either a successful value or a failure value).
It is useful when your effect does not involve any asynchronous tasks and you need to handle both the success or failure outcomes.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runSyncEither(Effect.succeed(1)) // { _tag: 'Right', right: 1 }

Effect.runSyncEither(Effect.fail("error")) // { _tag: 'Left', left: 'error' }
```

<Warning>
  `runSyncEither` will throw an error if your Effect performs any asynchronous
  tasks
</Warning>

```ts
Effect.runSyncEither(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))) // throws
```

## runSyncExit

The `runSyncExit` function is used to execute an Effect synchronously, which means it runs immediately and returns the result as an `Exit`
(a data type used to represent the possibility of either a successful value or a failure value).
It is useful when your effect does not involve any asynchronous tasks and you need to handle both the success or failure outcomes.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.succeed(1)) // { _tag: 'Success', ... }

Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.fail("error")) // { _tag: 'Failure', ... }
```

<Warning>
  `runSyncExit` will throw an error if your Effect performs any asynchronous
  tasks
</Warning>

```ts
Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))) // throws
```

## runPromise

The `runPromise` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise`.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runPromise(Effect.succeed(1)) // Promise { 1 }
```

<Warning>`runPromise` will reject with an error if your Effect fails</Warning>

```ts
Effect.runPromise(Effect.fail("error")) // rejected Promise
```

## runPromiseEither

The `runPromiseEither` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise` that resolves to an `Either`
(a data type used to represent the possibility of either a successful value or a failure value).
It is useful when you need to handle both the success or failure outcomes.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runPromiseEither(Effect.succeed(1)) // Promise { { _tag: 'Right', right: 1 } }

Effect.runPromiseEither(Effect.fail("error")) // Promise { { _tag: 'Left', left: 'error' } }
```

## runPromiseExit

The `runPromiseExit` function is used to execute an Effect and obtain the result as a `Promise` that resolves to an `Exit`
(a data type used to represent the possibility of either a successful value or a failure value).
It is useful when you need to handle both the success or failure outcomes.

```ts
import * as Effect from "@effect/io/Effect"

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.succeed(1)) // Promise { _tag: 'Success', ... } }

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.fail("error")) // Promise { { _tag: 'Failure', ... } }
```

## Cheatsheet

<Design>
  The recommended approach is to design your program with the majority of its
  logic as Effects. It's advisable to use the `run*` functions closer to the
  "edge" of your program. This approach allows for greater flexibility in
  executing your program and building sophisticated Effects.
</Design>

The table provides a summary of the available `run*` functions, along with their input and output types, allowing you to choose the appropriate function based on your needs.

| **Name**           | **Given**             | **To**                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `runSync`          | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `A`                     |
| `runSyncEither`    | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `Either<E, A>`          |
| `runSyncExit`      | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `Exit<E, A>`            |
| `runPromise`       | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `Promise<A>`            |
| `runPromiseEither` | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `Promise<Either<E, A>>` |
| `runPromiseExit`   | `Effect<never, E, A>` | `Promise<Exit<E, A>>`   |

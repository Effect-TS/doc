# Create a New Effect Project

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up a new Effect project from scratch using plain **TypeScript**.

<Steps>
### Create a project directory and navigate into it

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir hello-effect
cd hello-effect
```

### Initialize a TypeScript project using npm

```sh
npm init -y
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

This creates a `package.json` file with an initial setup for your TypeScript project.

### Initialize TypeScript

```sh
npx tsc --init
```

When running this command, it will generate a `tsconfig.json` file that contains configuration options for TypeScript. One of the most important options to consider is the `strict` flag.

Make sure to open the `tsconfig.json` file and verify that the value of the `strict` option is set to `true`.

### Install the necessary packages

```sh
npm install @effect/io @effect/data
```

These packages will provide the foundational functionality for your Effect project.

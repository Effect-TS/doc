# Welcome to Effect

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers
easily create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs.

One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages
[structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency)
to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

Other notable features of Effect include:

- **Concurrency**: Achieve highly-scalable, ultra low-latency applications
  through Effect's fiber-based concurrency model
- **Composability**: Construct highly maintainable, readable, and flexible
  software through the use of small, reusable building blocks
- **Resource Safety**: Safely manage acquisition and release of resources,
  even when your program fails
- **Type Safety**: Leverage the TypeScript type system to the fullest with
  Effect's focus on type inference and type safety
- **Asynchronicity**: Write code that looks the same, whether it is
  synchronous or asynchronous
- **Observability**: With full tracing capabilities, you can easily debug
  and monitor the execution of your Effect program

We've worked hard to create comprehensive and approachable documentation

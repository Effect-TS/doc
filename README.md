## Guidelines

We are following the guidelines provided by [https://documentation.divio.com/](https://documentation.divio.com/).

The documentation is organized into six main sections to help you navigate and contribute effectively:

1. Concepts (aka Explanations in documentation.divio.com): In this section, you'll find detailed explanations and discussions about various concepts related to Effect. These resources aim to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

   This section is designed for **new developers** who are interested in understanding the **principles** of Effect. It introduces the fundamental concepts and explains the reasons behind using Effect. (TLDR _It introduces the "what" and "why" of Effect_)

2. Effect Essentials: This section covers the fundamental components and core concepts of Effect. It serves as a starting point for beginners and provides essential information to get you up to speed.

   This section is tailored for **new developers** who want to learn about the **practical aspects** of Effect. It covers the essential core functionalities. It is recommended to read this section in its entirety, in the specified order. (TLDR _It covers the super “core” stuff_)

3. Tutorials: The tutorials section is specifically designed for beginners. It offers step-by-step instructions and practical examples to help you learn Effect effectively. Follow these tutorials to gain hands-on experience and build a solid foundation.

   This section provides step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks. It serves as a guide for **beginners** to start building their applications with Effect. While readers can explore different tutorials based on their needs, it is still advisable to read all the tutorials in sequence to grasp a comprehensive understanding. (TLDR _the (beginner) reader can start branching out_)

4. Guides: In the How-to Guides section, you'll find instructions on how to accomplish specific tasks using Effect. These guides are targeted towards users with some experience and provide detailed steps to achieve particular outcomes or solve common problems.

   Similar to tutorials, guides offer instructions for accomplishing specific tasks. However, these guides are intended for **users with more experience** in Effect. They address more advanced scenarios and introduce additional advanced components of Effect that can help solve sophisticated problems. (TLDR _like one-off “articles” related to Effect, can introduce new code_)

5. Reference: The Reference Guides section contains technical descriptions and comprehensive references for Effect. This section is a valuable resource for in-depth exploration of the machinery, APIs, and features of Effect. It serves as a go-to reference for detailed information.

6. More: The More section includes miscellaneous resources that can't be categorized into the previous sections. Here, you'll find additional materials such as FAQ, Glossary, and other relevant information that complements the other sections of the documentation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing?

Please make sure to run the `pnpm run lint`, or `pnpm run lint --fix` to auto fix any formatting issues.

## Additional Notes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

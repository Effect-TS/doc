This is a [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) docs site.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing?

Please make sure to run the `pnpm run lint`, or `pnpm run lint --fix` to auto fix any formatting issues.

Note: If your markdown contains a mermaid snippet, please place a `{/* prettier-ignore */}` comment on top of the snippet - otherwise, your formatting might not look correct.

## Additional Notes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

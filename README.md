## Guidelines

We are following the guidelines provided by [https://documentation.divio.com/](https://documentation.divio.com/).

The documentation is organized into six main sections to help you navigate and contribute effectively:

1. Concepts (aka Explanations in documentation.divio.com): In this section, you'll find detailed explanations and discussions about various concepts related to Effect. These resources aim to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

   This section is designed for **new developers** who are interested in understanding the **principles** of Effect. It introduces the fundamental concepts and explains the reasons behind using Effect. (TLDR _It introduces the "what" and "why" of Effect_)

2. Effect Essentials: This section covers the fundamental components and core concepts of Effect. It serves as a starting point for beginners and provides essential information to get you up to speed.

   This section is tailored for **new developers** who want to learn about the **practical aspects** of Effect. It covers the essential core functionalities. It is recommended to read this section in its entirety, in the specified order. (TLDR _It covers the super “core” stuff_)

3. Tutorials: The tutorials section is specifically designed for beginners. It offers step-by-step instructions and practical examples to help you learn Effect effectively. Follow these tutorials to gain hands-on experience and build a solid foundation.

   This section provides step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks. It serves as a guide for **beginners** to start building their applications with Effect. While readers can explore different tutorials based on their needs, it is still advisable to read all the tutorials in sequence to grasp a comprehensive understanding. (TLDR _the (beginner) reader can start branching out_)

4. Guides: In the How-to Guides section, you'll find instructions on how to accomplish specific tasks using Effect. These guides are targeted towards users with some experience and provide detailed steps to achieve particular outcomes or solve common problems.

   Similar to tutorials, guides offer instructions for accomplishing specific tasks. However, these guides are intended for **users with more experience** in Effect. They address more advanced scenarios and introduce additional advanced components of Effect that can help solve sophisticated problems. (TLDR _like one-off “articles” related to Effect, can introduce new code_)

5. Reference: The Reference Guides section contains technical descriptions and comprehensive references for Effect. This section is a valuable resource for in-depth exploration of the machinery, APIs, and features of Effect. It serves as a go-to reference for detailed information.

6. More: The More section includes miscellaneous resources that can't be categorized into the previous sections. Here, you'll find additional materials such as FAQ, Glossary, and other relevant information that complements the other sections of the documentation.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source project! We welcome your contributions to enhance the content on our website.

### Process

We follow a phased approach to add and refine the contents of our website:

**Phase 1**: In this initial phase, we have identified a series of pages and added them as "stubs". Currently, we are in the process of filling these stubs with content. This phase serves to refine the process, make important decisions regarding examples, warnings, errors, and more. We aim to test and validate this phase thoroughly, which may take a bit longer as it is the first cycle.

**Feedback and Stubs Proposals**: We value your input and suggestions. If you have proposals for new stub pages or if you would like to provide feedback on existing pages, please open an issue in our repository. We appreciate your involvement in shaping the future of our documentation.

**Questions and Clarifications**: If you have any doubts or require assistance regarding the contribution process, please join our Discord community. You can ask your questions and seek clarifications in the dedicated [Docs channel](https://discord.com/channels/795981131316985866/848185224356691978).

Once again, thank you for considering contributing to our project. We look forward to your valuable contributions to make our documentation even better!

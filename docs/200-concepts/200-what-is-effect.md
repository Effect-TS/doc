## Stage of Development

Our library is still very much under active development - i.e. we do not have a major release yet. The majority of our libraries are published on NPM under the `@effect-ts` namespace.

However, we have been hard at work on an updated version of our core library which has a number of new features/enhancements/performance improvements and is based upon the improvements that the folks developing ZIO are making for their 2.0 release. The updated version of our library, and future releases of the rest of our libraries will be published under the `@effect` namespace on NPM.

## Using Effect

Though the library is still under active development, Effect is currently powering many production applications powered by Effect in production.
